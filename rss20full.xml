  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Speaker experience at DevFest‚Äô19</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>This was my first to DevFest as a speaker although I was an attendee for the same last year. This time Google Developers Group organised DevFest at Coimbatore and it was the first time the city was experiencing such a huge tech fest. I was very happy to be invited here as a speaker, I was amongst the tech giants. I also appreciate the fact that DevFest is not only for Google Open source community to share the stage but also there was a diverse participation for the same.</p>
<p>

<p>I spoke on my all time favorite topic ‚ÄúWebXR: The Journey to the Center of Reality‚Äù, I tried to grab the show with the demos and made the audience to experience <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Hubs</a> as well. There were roughly 100 participants attending the event. To make the talk more interesting I distributed handouts at the event and asked the audience to experience some AR by opening an URL on their mobile phones.</p>

<p>All in all, I liked the hospitality and it was also a good networking with fellow Mozillians from all time. Also I liked the venue which was set up well and Coimbatore was amazing as always <img alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - Common Voice Ranchi Sprint</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/?p=1144</guid>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Common Voice is a project to help make voice recognition open to everyone. To create voice systems, developers need an extremely large amount of voice data. Most of the data used by large companies aren‚Äôt available to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we‚Äôve launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open and accessible to everyone! Raise your voice and get involved!</p>
<p><img alt="commonvoice-header.png" class="alignnone  wp-image-1146" height="315" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/commonvoice-header.png?w=678&amp;h=315" width="678" /></p>

<p>We in Ranchi decided to host a series of events to achieve a certain goal for Common Voice.</p>
<p>The goal of this series was to achieve 6000 Clips of Audio Spoken from each participant, and tell you upfront, we did!</p>
<p>We kept the event on each Friday with limited participants:</p>

  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - Beta Testing BugHunting</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/?p=1123</guid>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Hello Everyone, It‚Äôs been almost 9 months since I wrote a blog. There are pending blogs coming soon from Oct 2018, which includes my journey experience and speaking experience from southeast Asia.</p>
<p>After a series of WebExtension events in Ranchi, It was time to test our Favorite browser, we organized two BugHunting events one on <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/beta-testing-bughunter-ranchi/">25-May-2019</a> and next on <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/beta-testing-bughunter-ranchi-2/">09-June-2019</a>.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-38-30/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-38-30.jpg?w=80&amp;h=150" width="80" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-38-28/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-38-28.jpg?w=79&amp;h=150" width="79" /></a>

<p>The first event started with downloading the Firefox Preview after signing and setting up the Google Play account. We have also discussed the importance of Bug and why one should always report.</p>
<p>Mozilla was launching a NEW Android web browser and they needed us to get it ready for the free and open web.</p>
<p>We followed How to Bug Hunt section of <a href="https://events.mozilla.org/becomeabetatestingbughunter" rel="nofollow">https://events.mozilla.org/becomeabetatestingbughunter</a> and Shared the <a href="https://bughunterissues.mozilla.community/">bug entry details</a></p>
<p>The event concluded with some delicious food at dinner as most of them were keeping Ramadan Fast. So, we preferred the night to do the event.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2019-07-16_14-17-10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1135" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-10.jpg?w=788" /><img alt="photo_2019-07-16_14-17-12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1134" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-12.jpg?w=788" /><img alt="photo_2019-07-16_14-17-15" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-15.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>The second event had a different goal, we divided the team into two, one who attended previous Bug Hunting Event and the second set of people were new to Bug Hunting.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-40/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-40.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-42/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-42.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-39/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-39.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/beta-testing-bughunting/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-33/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-33.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>

<p>For newbies were followed the above steps and for ones who attended the previous event, were asked to go through bugs faced by each other and helping others to file the bug they encounter. We have submitted 56 bugs in total using bug entry.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2019-07-16_14-17-29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1138" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/photo_2019-07-16_14-17-29-1.jpg?w=788" /></p>

  <title>Viswaprasath KS - WebXR talk at VIT DevSpace</title>

    <![CDATA[<p>VIT, Vellore is one of the most reputed college in Tamilnadu. At the end of this March they organized <a href="https://devspace.csivit.com/">DevSpace</a>, Computer science department and Computer Society Students branch of college teamed up and organized this event. It is one of the amazing event and the students were very enthusiastic to learn more. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" class="wp-image-902" src="https://vp7techie.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_20190512_231707.jpg" />DevSpace 2019 Speaker Tag</figure>



<p>I got opportunity to share about WebXR (focusing WebAR mostly using Aframe and AR.js) for this event.  I was very excited to talk about WebAR for this event mainly because this is the first time I am going to give the talk  on this topic and as usual my Mozilla Techspeaker friends and MozillaReps helped me a lot to prepare this topic. To name few friends Fabien, Karthikeyan and Bhuvana.</p>



<p><strong>My Agenda of the Talk</strong></p>



<ul><li>To discuss Why WebAR instead of Native</li><li>Different Technologies / libraries</li><li>Different types of AR apps</li><li>What is Aframe<ul><li>Showing Demos of Aframe</li><li>EC System in Aframe</li></ul></li><li>What is Marker Based AR<ul><li>Building Custom Markers</li></ul></li><li>Limitations of Various Libraries</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why this is amazing event</strong></p>



<p>Devspace has attracted more number of students and student startup. Around 150 students had attended my session.  There were some more session a day before and after my session. Session from Amazon, IBM Watson,  branch.io and so on were there.  Then in the afternoon the hackathon was there.  It will be great if more and more session like this happen at this college. After the event was having the discussion with the  organizers  about improving the event. There was a plan from the team to make the FOSS Specific conference to bring in more students across Tamilnadu. Two teams who were doing projects at the hackathon had been doing projects related to Augmented Reality. They were thinking to use Aframe and AR.js.  Still most of the students / professional are thinking more projects around Marker based AR or when they go for Markerless AR then its very huge for implementing. More proper library support should come so developers can hack and build some amazing things.</p>



<p>I am very happy and should thank organizers team for the effort they made. They helped right from booking the tickets, late night check-in to the room for my stay, dropping me again at the railway, the ID card they designed, fetching the details about the speakers instead of asking us.</p>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Discovery of another passion!</title>

    <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During this year‚Äôs traditional festival of Tamil Nadu, I not only celebrated it in a holy way but also I <em><strong>learnt</strong></em>, <em><strong>shared</strong></em> and <em><strong>discovered</strong></em>. Yes, this was the exact time that the<a href="https://events.mozilla.org/firefoxfightsforyoucampaign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">¬†</a><strong><a href="https://events.mozilla.org/firefoxfightsforyoucampaign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Firefox Fights For You</a>¬†</strong>video challenge was open and I was always eager to put my creative skills into this.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2019-04-08_00-02-53" class="  wp-image-337 aligncenter" height="346" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/photo_2019-04-08_00-02-53.jpg?w=461&amp;h=346" width="461" /></p>
<p><strong>Learnt:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the challenged was announced I questioned myself how to do this in a unique way because I was sure that everyone willl literally localise the content and edit the videos accordingly. But to stand out of the crowd there must be a wow-factor that not only impress the judges but also attract a lot in YouTube and other social media platforms as there were two types of awards. So, I thought since the harvest festival of my state was also fast approaching I gathered my friends and other Mozillians in my town as they had a lot of festive holidays. The next day, we planned to go to the country side nearby and do the video shoot. The plan was to do the video not only with localised content (the <strong>Mozilla TN L10n¬†</strong>played a vital role in the precised translation), but also to show the culture of our region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After we stepped into the fields the villagers looked at us in surprise and mistook us as the movie actors/ directors. I spoke with them all and made them feel comfortable and asked them to participate in the video too. Although many of them were shy, I managed to convince a few girls and boys to do a little stuff.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2019-04-08_00-00-41" class="  wp-image-336 aligncenter" height="257" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/photo_2019-04-08_00-00-41.jpg?w=456&amp;h=257" width="456" /></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Shared:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We took a few breaks in between the shoot and I observed these young crowd from the country side alone happened to use smart phones. I was happy that they were digitally connected, so I just tested their literarcy on web as they had some 2G speed internet connected to their phones and also they have laptops at home which they get from the government for free of cost. I asked them the frequent browser they use and the default answer was Google and I asked them why not¬†<strong>Firefox¬†</strong>and their response was that they did not know much about it because they are hardly even taught to handle the gadgets but just they see Google everywhere they even thought its the only existing browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took this opportunity to share them what latest¬†<strong><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Firefox browser</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.rocket&amp;hl=en_IN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Firefox Lite</a>¬†</strong> has for them and how they must be very aware of the ‚Äúprivacy and security‚Äù. It was very new to them and I also showed them <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MDN</a>, which willl be helpful for them start with. They apparantely did not know they can develop things themselves and even make their own user. Moreover, I also encouraged all the people of different ages to use internet in a healthy way because the community consisted of farmers and owners of very small-scale industries. They were awe-struck to know the benefits and opportunites.</p>

<p><strong>Discovered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The place where we went to take a video shoot at last became a campaign mission. Anyway I loved the way things went. I am so happy that I educated many and also I provided certain directions on how the video has to be composed and asked everyone to tell out the dialogues assigned to them.</p>
<p>The main things that highlight our video:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Localised precisely</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clarity on the content</strong></li>
<li><strong>Most of the participants were <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mozillians</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Spread it widely</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the videos were uploaded on <a href="https://youtu.be/pze7UZoA5KA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a>¬†and the words were spread on many platform (the Mozilla TN Social Media team did a great job!). Also I was inspired with the other <a href="https://youtu.be/XlDKT5rPW_E?list=PLwdR-058nLX6ow0JNTs5vzsnU3DAxRdvn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videos</a> too and I appreciate everyone who took efforts to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After few days, the winners were announced and was really astonished to see that ‚Äúwe‚Äù won the ‚Äú<strong>The most Popularity Award</strong>‚Äú. Yes, it was a great team to work with and I thank every <a href="https://mozillatn.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MozillaTN¬†</a>¬†contributor who worked on bringing out things very perfectly as I tried to visualize.</p>

  <title>Viswaprasath KS - Add-ons session at LPU</title>

    <![CDATA[<p>LPU generally called as Lovely Professional University is well known university in India. Recently the students club organized one of the amazing event  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiveIntoOpenSource?src=hashtag_click">#DiveIntoOpenSource</a>  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" class="wp-image-890" src="https://vp7techie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/d2sfhbkwwaoixiq.jpeg" /></figure>



<p>It was not a very easy travel to LPU. I to some extent I love travel but too much of travel is very difficult. The schedule of travel was very difficult around 7:30 PM i started from office, my flight was around 10:30 reached Delhi around 2:00 and was there for more than 3 hours and then from 5:30 started from there and reached AMRITSAR around 6:45. From there Amritsar started in the bus and travelled to Punjab and reached around 10:00.  It was very difficult travel which was first time inside India. I had the keynote session ‚ÄúGetting Started with Open source‚Äù where I was about to share my journey in Open source. Since I reached late the students were waiting that time was caught by  Vishal, this is the really  good attitude which I liked.  I always say to my mentee we should always make sure no one waits for us. In India, still we are new to FOSS technologies, students / professionals still go behind Brand names even when they know / use the alternatives.</p>



<p></p>

</div></figure>



<p>So I got up freshen-up  and reached the Workshop room around 10:40. There myself and Shivam started our session on WebExtension. This topic is always close to my heart. WebExtension is one the way we can interact with Browser Features and make them work for us. Browser is always meant for users to work, it will obey for us and this is the way its designed for. Browser are designed for people. Myself and Shivam divided the Session as below.</p>



<ul><li>Introduction of WebExtension by Viswaprasath<ol><li>What is WebExtension</li><li>Types of UI and Scripts</li><li>How to configure developer settings in Browser</li></ol></li><li>Live coding and Demo by Shivam</li><li>Code explanation by Viswa</li></ul>

</div></figure>



<p>Each and every session is unique, we get to meet large number of audience and learn something new from them. One of the feedback I got which was ‚ÄúThey got to learn how the<strong> Keep by Google </strong>Add-on on Chrome sends selected data to keep.google.com‚Äù ( an example using Context menu)  Around 2 PM we finished our session and started for lunch.</p>



<p>In the afternoon session We had other session in the afternoon.</p>



<ul><li>Plasma Mobile </li><li>Kotlin</li><li>Git and Github</li></ul>



<p>At the end of the day we had some of the group pics and ice breaking sessions like Quiz.</p>

<p>As a speaker I personally vouch other Evangelist should come to this college and share their technical knowledge. I can say the students who attended the event had enough knowledge to under Javascript / Kotlin / Other topic. I even saw some of them were easily using Amazon AWS.</p>



<p>I was Unfortunate was not there for the second day, heard we had session on pontoon L10N tool, Aframe and many more. </p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Each one of us have some goals to complete, things to learn, and places to visit. With the year getting ended, it is time to lock back and see what all did we do for the last 365 days.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Well, 2018 have been a phenomenal year for me. Working with Addons aka AMO Team is where the major part of 2018 was spent. I have learned how to work remotely with a cross-cultural team. I have met some super awesome people like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/caitmuenster" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Caitlin</a>¬†, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/rebmullin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rebecca</a> and many more. I fixed ~50 Bugs in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://addons.mozilla.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">AMO</em></a>. I got to meet a lot of great people, built connections and learned things. I am really happy to see few of my goals getting completed. I failed of the things miserably too.</p>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - An escape to The Square Mile #Mozfest2018</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><strong>Dates of the event: 26,27 and 28, Oct 2018.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue: Ravensbourne University, London</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first trip overseas came true¬† just because of Mozilla and Mozfest2018. In first place my sincere thanks to Mozilla Foundations and Sarah Allen for helping me to make myself all way to London and for Mozfest.</p>
<p><img alt="Image from iOS(1).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298" height="294" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/image-from-ios1.jpg?w=784" width="392" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I arrived at the Heathrow airport on 25th morning with my crew of Indians and we started to explore the city with our journey in the tubes. An ecstatic view of old and new buildings and with the 6 degree celsius made me remember Ooty and Kodaikanal in India. It was like me entering into a country whose replica remain similar under the name of India. So it was like a home away from home. When I was initially confused with things happening around it was so good to see the British people helping me and easing me out despite me being a stranger.</p>

<a href="https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/11/03/an-escape-to-the-square-mile-mozfest2018/img_3245/#main"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_3245.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I stayed at Modrian London- The sea containers hotel, which was located at the banks of Thames river and the location was very busy with tourists, office workers and Mozillians. A walk along the bank of Thames was very serene and relaxing. Every morning I loved the breakfast at the hotel and the British style of starters satisfied my appetite.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_3330" class="  wp-image-310 aligncenter" height="263" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_3330.jpg?w=350&amp;h=263" width="350" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 26th morning I was very eager to meet all the virtual people in their physical forms. Had a few minutes of training session and met other facilitators who had come for the same purpose as me. I was thrilled to see people who were attending Mozfest for¬† the 3rd or 4th time¬†consecutively and learnt a lot from their experience as a veteran. Then we moved to our spaces and I introduced myself to the team. There I saw my family, yes they are none other than the wranglers of my space, and my face beamed with excitement when I met them in person. David Bild, Mariaon, Stephanie, Yo Yehudi and Marcos were all helpful to me throughout the days of the event, they guided and appreciated me for all the efforts I paid for.<img alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img alt="Dqmjqg6WkAAFfrl" class="  wp-image-303 aligncenter" height="236" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/dqmjqg6wkaaffrl.jpg?w=315&amp;h=236" width="315" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also made a poster which was appreciated by many and I stuck it on the elevator in order to promote my session. But what I did was very minimal when compared to the posters of other sessions which were all around from washrooms to trash cans, where ever there was little space left.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2018-11-03_13-23-21.jpg" class="  wp-image-306 aligncenter" height="241" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/photo_2018-11-03_13-23-21.jpg?w=321&amp;h=241" width="321" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the big day came, it was 27th and I had to present my session on ‚ÄúFarmer‚Äôs Gear‚Äù under the Openness space and I was a bit tensed because my presentation was the first session of the day. Initially I did not see much participants but later I went around to call people for my session. Atlast some 7 interested folks joined me and a few left before the conclusion. Not sure if they had to rush for their own sessions or something more interesting than mine<img alt="üôà" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f648.png" style="height: 1em;" /> . But my purpose was solved, I wanted some inputs in a diverse context and I did manage to get it. Thanks to Dirk and Zannah for helping me to organise my session plan. Although my audience were 7 in number after my session I went all over the space to know what was happening. In this way, when I met people and they asked me what session I had been doing for the weekend I got to spread a word about my project to more 20 people and they also gave me valuable feedback, so my number of participants is actually 27 . But it is not just for the number I was happy to get some volunteers who were eager enough to contribute for my project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, there was another session which impressed me a lot. It was called ‚ÄúVR colored girls musuem‚Äù <img alt="üòç" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60d.png" style="height: 1em;" /> and my passion towards VR and AR drove my interest to know more about it. I attended the session and was also ready to contribute for the same. It was astonishing to know that LaBrina Loving, Community Manager from Microsoft was also part of the project.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2018-11-01_01-16-41" class="  wp-image-307 aligncenter" height="314" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/photo_2018-11-01_01-16-41.jpg?w=419&amp;h=314" width="419" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 28th, I explored other spaces and was inquistive in solving the puzzles in the 7th floor.</p>
<p><img alt="Image from iOS" class="  wp-image-318 aligncenter" height="474" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/image-from-ios.jpg?w=355&amp;h=474" width="355" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mozfest is the right place to meet the people from Mozilla and Mozilla Reps program <img alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2764.png" style="height: 1em;" />, which is my favorite part not just because I am a Rep but because of the sole responsibilities and other stuff I do as a part of the Mozilla Community of my region. Happy to meet Konstatina and Michael Kohler, I did clarify all my doubts and also shared my experience as a Rep with them. Also, it was great to meet Caitlin and discussed my ideas I had for Mozilla Addons and how eager I was to develop one. David Ross helped me to take a tour through the Science Fair and helped me to connect with more people. I was all about awaiting for the openings of Tech Speakers and got the right chance to meet Flaki and expressed him my crave to join the program.</p>
<p><img alt="Dqndr2VWsAULH3T" class="  wp-image-319 aligncenter" height="177" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/dqndr2vwsaulh3t.jpg?w=266&amp;h=177" width="266" /></p>
<p>Also got the right chance to visit the Mozilla UK office and it was super awesome. Loved it!!! Discussed about Mozilla IoT and Firefox Mixed Reality and other trending projects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The final day came, the last day of the trip and I wanted to cover some popular attractions around and my fellow Indian Mozillians accompanied me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I just could not await for the next Mozfest. Truly I had so much attachment towards the place and people that I left London with drops of tears running down my eyes.</p>
<p>Mixture of emotions, thrill, connections, family, bonding and me made Mozfest2018 complete <img alt="üòç" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60d.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

    <![CDATA[<p><strong>DevConf.in 2018</strong> is the second annual Developers‚Äô Conference to be organized by Red Hat in Bengaluru, India. It is meant to provide a platform to the local FOSS community participants to come together and engage in the knowledge sharing through technical talks, workshops, panel discussions, hackathon, and such activities.</p>
<p>More about my talk and conference can be found <a href="https://github.com/rowdymehul/devconfIN">here</a>;</p>
<p>Our goal is to promote and educate people about authentication &amp; authorization. Also, learn about the different concepts JS and how that make up an application secure.</p>
<p>As usual this time also, at end moment I‚Äôve decided to attend this conference and since this conference is organized by <strong>Red Hat</strong> so I was quite excited to speak here. <strong>DevConf</strong> first time happening in India. This conference originally started on¬†<strong>10 September 2009</strong>, this was the first ever conference¬†organized by <strong>Red Hat Czech Republic</strong> in the <strong>Czech Republic</strong> and the rest is history.<span id="more-1634"></span></p>
<p>Due to flight delayed I reached the hotel late at night and was too tired but there some points left to add in the presentation. I was actually preparing some demos which I wanted to demonstrate to participants. Even after so much tired the energy level was same, thanks to Red Bull as well to keep me awake. <img alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I have talked on ‚Äú<strong>JS Authentication with Auth0</strong>‚Äú. This was introductory talk about the JS Authentication, where we have discussed the role that Auth0 authentication plays in modern software development where it is a lot more than just the login screen.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Looking forward to address amazing audience <img alt="üòé" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60e.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/Auth0Ambassador?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Auth0Ambassador</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Auth0Community?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Auth0Community</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/authentication?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#authentication</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Identity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Identity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Security?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Security</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devconf18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#devconf18</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#devconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RedHat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RedHat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/redhatopen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@redhatopen</a> <a href="https://t.co/7H2REmaAuR">pic.twitter.com/7H2REmaAuR</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>First, we gave a bit of background that Authentication and Authorization are two different processes. This time Viral Parmar who is a cybersecurity expert in his region join me for this session and shared some great trips to about online security.</p>
<p>I ‚Äôve already discovered <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>, an Authentication as a Service. Using their JavaScript SDK you can able to offer social logins using Github, Facebook and much more from the web interface. At the time of writing it‚Äôs free for up to 7000 registered users and they offer a nice web interface to manage all users who signed up / logged in. More you can explore from <a href="https://auth0.com/opensource">here</a>;</p>
<h3>We have also covered the following points in the talk;</h3>
<ul>
<li>web security¬†<span class="module__title__link">Vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li>Passwordless authentication</li>
<li>SSO</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://auth0.com/opensource">Auth0</a> as authentication</li>
<li>Brute force <span class="module__title__link">attack</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk, we have received so many questions but mostly on <strong>SSO</strong> as participants are quite curious to know more about. Some were working professionals and there were asking about how they implement <strong>SSO</strong> on their business set up so all an all it was quite a healthy discussion. Some questions we have answered them after wrap up and over a cup of coffee in break session.</p>
<p>Also, while walking to booth sections got a chance to interact with many participants from the conference, some were known faces who attended our talk and some came up with new questions. This is the best part of being in the community where you will get a chance to exchange your knowledge and you always go back home with some new learning or experience.</p>

<p>In my every event I am always seeking for feedback‚Äôs from participants/attendees/visitors, doesn‚Äôt matter its positive or negative because if you know the feedback you can definitely work on it to improve for next time to make it better.</p>

<p><strong>Dates of the event: 04 &amp; 05, August, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue : Christ University, Bangalore, India.</strong></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the first conference as a speaker I attended and it turned out to be a great event with huge bunch of people interested in tech and only tech (I like this kind of community basically). The whole space around me was filled with chit-chats on technology, discussions about programming and fresh Open Source ideas. The decorum was well maintained with debates and discussions in workshops and speaker sessions, ultimately a lot of ideas shared. So, all¬† this can happen only in this interesting arena called ‚ÄúDevconf‚Äù.</p>
<p><img alt="DSC_0197" class="aligncenter  wp-image-212" height="354" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/dsc_0197.jpg?w=199&amp;h=354" width="199" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Devconf 2018- India, is the second annual meetup organised by Redhat and one of the massive events for all the like minded tech savvy people under one roof. It was a 2-day conference and the first day the intensity of the summit was elevated with the keynote session by Ric Wheeler on his journey in Open Source. I went around for other talks and also was part of the Mozilla Booth where my contributions on WebVR were displayed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the evening the most awaited part happened, I delivered my talk under the title : ‚ÄúBehind the screen: WebXR revealed‚Äù. It was very interesting to have assorted age group people and they were interested to learn more about what is Virtual/Augmented/ Mixed Reality. I demonstrated a few samples on how I used A-frame to create different VR/AR scenes. The best part is I had many people who spoke with me after the talk and how they very curious to go about this. Happened to meet much experienced audience from giant industries too and they discussed with me on how this technology can be of great help to improve their organisations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The second day was kick started with the keynote session by Christian Heimes, who spoke on security and efficient encryption techniques. I was fortunate to meet him in person on his visit to the Booth area and explained about the products we worked on. Definitely, he‚Äôs a man of good humane and is constantly in touch with me and eager enough to know more about my interest on AR/VR.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These two days I enjoyed as it was like more of a carnival and this was a great opportunity to meet a lot of my fellow Mozillians. A lot of whom I was contacting virtually so I little struggled to recognise them <img alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f61b.png" style="height: 1em;" />¬† ¬†However, the multifacet community I had ever seen and always vibrant , so very proud a Mozillian.</p>

<p>Two months back CFP was released, as soon as I came to know about it applied for Mozilla Community booth, personally there was call from inside to apply for this meetup. We were very lucky our Mozilla community got opportunity to present various contribution areas at devconf, which is mostly dedicated to developers. And Priyanka shared about this in Mozilla India community mailing list.</p>
<p>This time MozillaIN community had Amazing booth where our focus is to share about <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aframe</a> , <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust Language</a> , <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebExtension</a></p>
<p><img alt="photo5990091300780748150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-873" height="800" src="https://vp7techie.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/photo5990091300780748150.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p>Before Meetup, one of the first task is to bring design for Booth, our theme was based on Rust, Firefox Family (&amp; Webextesion), Aframe, we gave this requirements to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/issues/215" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mozilla Open Design</a> team, and one of contributor from India Tanzeel Khan brought the beautiful design (above one). But due to some issues were not  able to print this, but in the large LCD TV we showed this majestic poster during break (when we are not showing demo).</p>
<p>Second major task was to bring pull contributors who are going to speak at various sessions and also volunteers who can be at booth. Our plan is to make sure minimum 3 are present at any moment  at booth. At first invited Ramdayal, Abhiram and other speakers, they brought in huge number of other Mozillians who will participate.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>The Day 1 started with amazing show by Christ University students. Then Ric Wheeler started Keynote <strong>‚ÄúOpen source is better for companies/businesses, communities and developers‚Äù</strong> of Devconf. Once Keynote is done, we (Ram dayal, Bhuvana and myself) started towards Exhibition area to setup up Mozilla booth. It was start of the day, there were already many open source booth setup by other communities ( Elastic, FSMK, devopedia , Openshift and so on..).</p>
<p>Soon we setup the Mozilla Booth, large number of attendees started joining us. Soon Abhiram joined us to help and share about Rust Language. He started to share about Rust and also about his Amazing rust series which is available in lynda.com for 1 month trial. He brought the QR code ready so whoever wants to learn can scan and visit website directly. Sharing his Tweet which he made after event.</p>

  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - LinuxCon China</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/?p=1081</guid>
  <link>https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/linuxcon-china/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>LinuxCon China was a technical conference for developers, operations experts (architects, sys admins, devops), business, compliance and legal leadership and other professionals to come together in an informal setting to learn from open source experts, have fascinating discussions, collaborate with peers, and gain a competitive advantage with innovative open solutions.</p>
<p>This year I got an opportunity to talk about and represent Auth0 and Mozilla at LinuxCon. It was a 3-day conference where My first talk was based on Serverless where I was representing Auth0 and next day I was representing Mozilla with A-frame and WebVR theme.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180626_092158" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1086" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_20180626_092158-e1530764692916.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>The first day was really amazing as I had to visit all the sponsor‚Äôs booth where I got swags and most importantly networking. My talk on Serverless was at 16:20 Chinese Time. It was wonderful to see many attendees waiting for the talk, I started the <a href="https://slides.com/mdsbzalam/lc3-china/">presentation</a> where I discussed the basics of Client-Server architecture and why we need security layer and how one can get started with serverless. The response of the talk was really good as many came after the session for the get started link and to clear their doubts. It was a good day at the conference.</p>

<p>The second day, I had an open session at the CNCC, where I was given a space where attendees came to interact and know about the project. The project I was having was of A-frame and WebVR. It was really fun to interact with the Chinese attendees as many were unable to understand or speak English, so I had to use VPN to use Google Translate( good translation <img alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ). Many were excited to know about A-frame since it requires a very little amount of background in computer science to get started. I have shared the links with them via email and wechat. It was a good day to conclude the conference and very happy to represent both Mozilla and Auth0.</p>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Taking WebXR to the most energetic gen</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/?p=159</guid>
  <link>https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/taking-webxr-to-the-most-energetic-gen/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><strong>Venue: Academic heights public school, Hyderabad</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 20.05.2018</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I in the first place wondered whether a topic like WebXR going to complicate the audience I targeted for the day. My audience included 50+ kids, their parents and their guardians of the AHP school. But when I showed the crowd the VR googles and asked the question what is it and what does that deal with, I got answers from 5 kids. With no doubt the kids were familiar with Virtual Reality as they had played games in malls and game arcades in their city. Also they were familiar with Augmented Reality as they had played Pokemon Go in their mobile phones. This eventually made my job easy.</p>

<p><img alt="IMG_2139.JPG" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274" height="303" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2139.jpg?w=404" width="404" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I amused them with the fusing results of AR and VR and how this can lead to WebXR. They loved experimenting with the VR googles. They in fact gave solutions on how their education system can be improvised with technologies like these. It was very much vibrant to see these kids who wanted to make their classrooms more interesting.</p>

<p><img alt="2.jpg" class="  wp-image-273 aligncenter" height="249" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/21.jpg?w=190&amp;h=249" width="190" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon session was mainly focussed for parents and guardians. I emphasised on why this gen must be involved in learning latest technology. Also in most parts of India after a girl child finishes her studies, about 70-80% percent are married at an earlier age (that is before they getting an industry ot real technology exposure), so application of knowledge is very less. To overcome this I shared ideas and motivated the parents to allow their girls to freely explore what they need in life in terms of technology or any other innovation. Furthermore, I took myself as an example and told them my journey and how I got into Mozilla and also how Mozilla helps its women contributors through its Womoz program.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2205.JPG" class="aligncenter  wp-image-271" height="234" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_22051.jpg?w=313&amp;h=234" width="313" /></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The final touch as usual, no matter whatever the age group my audience fall into, they always love the swags from Mozilla.</p>
<p><img alt="1.jpg" class="  wp-image-272 aligncenter" height="218" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/11.jpg?w=289&amp;h=218" width="289" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a closing note, I thank AHP school, Hyderabad for inviting me as a speaker for their Summer School progam 2018. Also my humblest gratitude to Mozilla and Shahbaz (my Reps mentor) for always encouraging me to participate in these wonderful events.</p>]]>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Organise things right!</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Global Sprint which was going throughout the world on various projects made Fahima and me to think about the event in our home town too. So I took the initiative to organise all things required for this event. I thought this way I would also learn a lot on event organisation and hosting.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2018-05-11_13-34-54" class="  wp-image-262 aligncenter" height="277" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/photo_2018-05-11_13-34-541.jpg?w=370&amp;h=277" width="370" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had 15+ participants who actively took part in this event. The event was focussed on SOHW(Spread Open Healthy Web) project and explained in what ways the participants can do their part in this project.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2107" class="  wp-image-263 aligncenter" height="290" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_21071.jpg?w=387&amp;h=290" width="387" /></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this project we had various issues and its main objective was to be a single point of access to the resources thus helping the newbies to start their contributions. The issue had various interesting topics like making memes, designing logo and also many stuffs related to building the webpage for this particular project. Eventually, there were many options to contribute.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we attended the global online conference call where everyone got an opportunity to speak about their projects. It was indeed amazing to see other projects happening world-wide. Found that this sprint was indeed spread across miles and had a great impact in relevant to current technologies and open source.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>This is my second visit to Pune, after my recent <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//GNUNify_18">GNUify</a> event. GNUNify was mainly focused for Student developers, the target audience were getting started with Open source community. COeP Foss Meetup had well experienced developers and students who are contributing for FOSS community more than 1 year. Abhijit who is the professor at COEP and helping lot of students to get started with community. He is an amazing person I meet, who came forward to share his thoughts about my presentation and spends time with students and motivates them a lot.</p>
<p><img alt="COEP Talk on Stage" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/coep_talk.JPG" /></p>
<p>The hall was really big filled with 200 attendees. Energy was really good and I was really excited to give the presentation. For this presentation I have been showing the demo with Commands API and tabs.ExecuteScript API. The internet was really slow during my presentation, due to this therewas some breakage in the flow. Abhijit Sir, came forward to share his Mobile internet and I was able to show the demo of my Youtube Extension.</p>
<p>Some of the questions came around the Chrome Compatibility, and one of the long time Mozillian Friend Ankit gave suggestions in improving the Extensions which is used for demo.</p>
<p><img alt="COEP Ankit Question" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/coep_ankit.JPG" /></p>
<p>After my session we had amazing session by Kushal Das on SecureDrop. Then we had a session by Rahulkrishnan on Docker.</p>
<p>After the session we had a small Tea break session, where contributors from various projects came and had informal discussion. Some of the contributors who tried to become Mozilla Reps or tried to contribute to various projects shared the pros and cons in community.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to Ankit home and meet his family, had a very good tea time with them. After that we went to the near by mall and tried some amazing local food.</p>
<p>I personally felt this is amazing Meetup I have been. I really felt bad I didnt plan to attend the second day of the event. In upcoming years I will make sure to give talk on this Meetup. Personal thanks to Vikrant (student from coep), who was with me for the whole day.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>Lovely Professional University is a private university situated in Jalandhar, Punjab, India. It is a well know educational institutions in the country with around 34000 students and over 130 programs. Mrinal and I were invited to LPU for a workshop on WebVR ( Virtual Reality ). We reached LPU on 17th April and visited the campus.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1075" style="width: 798px;"><img alt="DSC_0002" class="alignright size-large wp-image-1075" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0002.jpg?w=788&amp;h=526" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1075">The morning started with a good cup of tea</p></div>
<p>We reached the auditorium on time. And yes it was filled with 1300 students. One of the biggest auditorium I have seen till now.</p>
<p><img alt="DSC_0013" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1062" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0013.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>The event started with a brief introduction of speakers and then I started the explaining the difference between Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. Also Why we need these technologies?</p>
<p><img alt="_DSC3335" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1073" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc3335-1.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Started with the Aframe Presentation slide to explain the basics of WebVR and A-frame. Students were really interested to know more about it.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/_dsc3346-2/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="100" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc3346-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/dsc_0010/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="100" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0010.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100" width="150" /></a>

<p>After a while, students were getting bored, so I started with Virtual Girlfriend story ( Prathamesh‚Äôs story it is ) to explain the difference of VR, AR, and MR. And what all application we can build and solve real problems.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>The event was really good, students asked many questions related to Mozilla, it‚Äôs product and Open Source in general. Would love to visit again <img alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Again trio has come together for a wonderful event. This time it was IIT-BHU. The event started with the introduction of the speakers, Shahbaz, Umesh and Prathamesh ( trio aka SUP ). Prathamesh started the session explaining the difference between VR, AR, and MR. People were amazed to know that they will be creating their VR experience after the brief presentation.</p>
<p>After Prathamesh, I talked about basics of WebVR and how easy it is to build in just a few lines of codes.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from 2018-04-09 23-30-28.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1046" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/screenshot-from-2018-04-09-23-30-28.png?w=788" /></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Date: 24<sup>th</sup> March,2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue: SRM University, Chennai</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day started with the inauguration by the chief guest, Mr. Raaman. It was an interesting talk on Linux forum and how open source plays the real trend in today‚Äôs world. I was very glad and proud to be amidst of great speakers who were very much senior to me in age and also in experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="photo_2018-09-10_13-18-24.jpg" class="  wp-image-276 aligncenter" height="196" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/photo_2018-09-10_13-18-24.jpg?w=196&amp;h=196" width="196" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My session happened in the second half slot and I initially gave a small pitching about my talk and audience who were interested to know more took part in my session. Surprisingly, I had 50+ enthusiastic audiences who were very keen to know the tricks and magic hidden in WebXR. I shared my in detail on how WebXR works followed by definitions on WebVR, WebAR and WebMR. Furthermore, I amused my participants with my demos and gave them an idea on how this technology can be used in real time for useful applications. Moreover, I shared about the WebVR Challenge and how to approach the same.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, it was a different experience and I happened to gather around lot more knowledge through the sessions handled by my co-speaker viz.,</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Jayesh on Rust</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sayaji on privacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anand on QA</strong></li>
<li><strong>Viswaprasath on Web-extensions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mehul on Auth0</strong></li>

    <![CDATA[<p>HackFest is IIT(ISM) Dhanbad‚Äôs 36-hour annual hackathon organized by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) and ACM Student Chapter, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.</p>
<p>The event started with an introduction of speakers. <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh</a>, <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/umesh/">Umesh</a>, and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahbaz/">Shahbaz</a> ( yep it‚Äôs me ), since we had limited time with us. So it was a quick talk-demo-workshop.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232299546" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232299546.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Prathamesh started with his favorite virtual girlfriend story to explain the concept of¬† Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. After a long and tiring hackathon, the audience seems interested and was into it.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232272809" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1015" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232272809.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>I talked about the basics of WebVR, why we brought the VR on Web and what are their advantages. Used Kevin‚Äôs presentation for explaining the concept in details with his amazing presentation (<a href="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/" rel="nofollow">https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining what WebVR is, we asked participants to visit <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="nofollow">https://aframe.io/</a> and remix the hello world example on¬† <a href="http://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://glitch.com/</a></p>
<p>¬†</p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>Due to the limited amount of time, participants couldn‚Äôt finish their idea. So we gave them a contest, where top 5 scenes will get a surprise gift from us.</p>
<p>And here comes, what we love most. After event photograph with the participants.</p>

<p>We will be seen together soon in IIT-BHU.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>WebMR is a new technology which is in its initial stages. WebMR was the thing which has brought a huge participation at Baroda.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly waiting for us. Event started with a brief introduction of the speakers. Prathamesh Chavan and I talked about our love to open source.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_103016_bokeh/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_103016_bokeh.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p>Prathamesh talked about the differences of WebVR WebAR and WebMR. His way of relating things to virtual girlfriend has brought a new spark in attendees.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_134118" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1003" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_134118.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>I talked about basics of Virtual reality and why we have brought the VR on Web. And how easy it is to code and experience the same.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_145209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1001" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_145209.jpg?w=788" /><br />

Lunch time, we went to Nosh Farmaiye, best place in town for chicken kebabs. Must place to visit when you‚Äôre in town.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_123451" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1004" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_123451.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>After the lunch we started the hand-on session of WebVR . And to do so nothing is better than a hello world example. We have used glitch to live demo the scenes.</p>
<p>First day concluded with the prize distribution to the top 5 teams.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180225_085802" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180225_085802.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Second day started with WebAR, I explained the differences and similarities in AR and VR. Here again started with hello world example using hero marker.<br />
And talked about new features of AR and VR.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_160339/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_160339.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - My first talk on WebXR</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/?p=128</guid>

    <![CDATA[<p>¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Date: 17.03.2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue : PES University, Bangalore, India.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was my first presentation on WebXR as my previous talks were mostly focused on WebVR and projects related to it. There were around 150+ enthusiastic participants who actively participated in this event.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180317_160448.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281" height="284" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180317_160448.jpg?w=758" width="379" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The morning first half session, I briefed about Mozilla and its projects. As the students haven‚Äôt come across Mozilla rather than its Firefox browser, I got this platform to rightly propagate about the community and how they can involve themselves in volunteer contributions both as individual and as an institution. ¬†I mainly emphasized on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add-ons/ Webextensions</li>
<li>Localisation</li>
<li>SuMo</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>WebVR</li>
<li>Mozilla Mixed reality</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forenoon second half session involved a deep dive into WebXR. I found the audience struck with surprise on how technology has rapidly grown and how Mozilla is also into the competition.¬† After giving a detailed notion on WebXR I showed a few demos on my contributions to WebVR and WebAR.</p>

<p></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the intervals the students got a chance to experience Virtual Reality world using VR googles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a feedback form to be filled by my audience and based on this I was about to predict the count of participants for my afternoon session. To my surprise almost 80% of the attendees came forward for the hands-on session.</p>

  <title>Viswaprasath KS - KGiSL Mozactivate 2018</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>KGiSL community space is very close to every Mozillian around Tamilnadu, we had our first meetup there. There are lot of events related to Mozilla and open source communities happen at this space. After so long time I got opportunity to come to this space and share my knowledge about the WebExtension.</p>
<p>For this event, I personally started training 6 students before the event. My main goal is to make sure they are in good position to explore more about WebExtensions and answer the questions which are asked by their friends during session. It is like Train the trainers. We in Mozilla India community are doing great job by developing many WebExtensions but at the same time the number of trainers are less and it started increasing slowly in past few days.</p>
<p>On the event day around 35 students appeared, the attendence was very less due to the Job Fair  happening in the city all of the sudden. Till Friday evening there were good amount of registration but sudden announcement of Job fair made Final year and Third year students to go there. They are the main audience of the session. But some of them turned up.</p>
<p>During this session I was discussing about ContextMenu, as the students will be more interested to hack them compared to any other API. The students present were able to grasp the knowledge very quickly. One of the interesting thing happned to me for the first time is, I have to work without computer; yes on that day I was using the Black board to teach students and this is the first time I am doing it. Explaining using Black board was very interesting and I was very happy to do it.</p>
<p><img alt="WebExtension workshop at KGiSL" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/Kgisl_hack.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was excited to know two of the attendees developed their extension and pushed them to AMO.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ShankarDhandapani/WebExtensions">Translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-selection/">Search</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mozillatn.github.io/KiTE/blog/KGISL-ADDON-Hack">Blog post by KGiSL club</a></p>
<p>Most intersting and must needed part is, Sriram created Video about his extension, how he developed and explained his code, how to run it in browser. This is one of the great job done. I used to suggest many students about this, and Many techspeakers are now focusing on creating video tutorials, thanks to Sriram as he started at this early time.</p>
<p></p><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div><p></p>
<p>In future I will be collobrating with this students and planning to continue creating more vidoes about WebExtensions.  This will be really helpful and we can bring more students as TechSpeakers in future.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>It all started with PyCon India. I met a few students of Aligarh Muslim University who were trying to teach about FOSS in their college. A few them were already contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">Coala</a>. We talked a bit and they were discussing problems they were facing to run that community. I already started a Mozilla community at my college in the earlier days. Since I brought up a lot of folks from my college community in the event, we together discussed <em>How to nurture FOSS communities in college</em> as part of PyCon India Open Spaces. Here is a glimpse of the same:</p>
<img alt="PyCon India Open Spaces on how to nurture FOSS communities in college" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-1.jpeg" />
<p>Later, these folks were excited and invited me as a speaker at their college. A lot of planning happened for the event and we were in touch almost daily for different things. We planned the event one and a half month in advance. Finally, on 24th Feb 2018, we decided to have a full-day event around FOSS at Aligarh Muslim University.</p>
<p>We left from Delhi at around 6:30 AM in the morning. We then halted at a cafe known as <cite>Break Point</cite> around Aligarh to have breakfast. We reached the university at around 10:20 AM.</p>
<p>We took some time to test the entire set-up and the event began at around 11:30 AM. I took the first session on <strong>Why you should contribute to Open Source</strong>. We discussed the question that somehow pops up sooner or later into everyone's mind while contributing to Open Source: <strong>What's in it for me?</strong>.</p>
<p>We discussed various pathways one can begin contributing to Open Source Projects like <strong>coding, writing docs, managing team, advocacy, documentation, translation, bug triaging, reviews, organization skills, soft skills</strong> &amp; tons of other things that come as a by-product.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning about different contribution pathways in FOSS" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-9.jpg" />
<p>You can find the slides here: <a class="reference external" href="http://sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/why-foss">Why you should contribute to Open Source?</a>.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-2.jpg" />
<p>We had a break for sometime and then started with the much awaited <strong>Add-ons session</strong>. Everyone was very excited to start learning to develop add-ons. I began with explaining the initial setup details &amp; discussed JSON briefly to bring everyone on the same page. To make most out of the event, We also organized a few events previously to teach basics of JavaScript &amp; JSON so that students so that they do not feel overwhelmed with the add-ons development.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-3.jpg" />
<p>Then Shashank (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/realslimshanky">@realslimshanky</a>) took over and discussed <tt class="docutils literal">manifest.json</tt> and it's importance. Later we developed a simple addon -- borderify, which displays a border on every site the user visits. Some students also modified their scripts to make their add-ons do different things and posted them on twitter. Shashank, me and Shivam Singhal (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/championshuttler">@championshuttler</a>) helped everyone with their problems during the development phase.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-4.jpg" />
<p>Since all of us are devs, we were able to quickly resolve queries of students. One of the most important things I noticed is that often people misspell either the name of their manifest file or some key in their manifest people resulting their add-on to not load during the debugging phase.</p>
<p>A lot of them then created addons on their own and modified their previously created borderify addon to do more stuff. I've tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/CuriousLearner/1a4b08dbf642be8e4dfeb9544c9ab4c9">collect some of them here</a>. For a more verbose list you can visit Twitter and search tweets tagging me (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">@ErSanyamKhurana</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozAMU">#MozAMU</a>.</p>
<p>Imaginations ran wild and one of the attendee created an addon that replaces the word <tt class="docutils literal">Google</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">Mozilla</tt> on every web page. You can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/husainhz7/GoogleMozilla/">his hack here</a></p>
<p>To make the session more interesting we gave add-ons stickers to anyone who answers the question about what we were just telling them. A lot of folks praised and tweeted about the addons they were generating. We were able to generate <strong>10,000+ impressions with more than 4,000+ accounts reached on Twitter for #MozAMU</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on no of impressions created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-11.png" />
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on top contributors created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-12.png" />
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="https://tweetreach.com/reports/20714737">read the full report here</a>.</p>
<p>Till this time, I never introduced to anyone about who am I and most importantly not listed any of my contributions in any of the projects. I don't want them to feel overwhelmed and assume that we people have some sort of superpowers that we're able to patch bugs in any FOSS project. I always make it a point to encourage them and help them land their first patch.</p>
<p>And my introduction summed that up in just one line <tt class="docutils literal">I'm one of you <span class="pre">--</span> a part of the community</tt>.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner) teaching about essential things to learn while contributing to FOSS projects" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-13.png" />
<p>We then hopped on to discuss <strong>How do I start contributing to Open Source?</strong> where we specifically discussed <strong>How to find bugs on different projects through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Enthusiastic folks learning about contributions for Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-7.jpg" />
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/#/">slides here</a>. Then I discussed other Open Source projects I've contributed to like <em>CPython, Django, Oppia, Mozilla's Devtools, Gecko-Engine &amp; tried to find out similarities in various bug trackers.</em> We then had a group photo with some of the attendees.</p>
<img alt="Group photo at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-5.jpg" />
<p>It was already 5 PM and we didn't go for Lunch since students kept us busy with their questions during the lunch break too :P</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic students asking questions in break" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-8.jpg" />
<p>So, we decided to hop-on to a restaurant nearby with the core-team of students that helped in organizing the event with so much enthusiasm.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-10.jpg" />
<p>Then we clicked one last photo before leaving Aligarh at around 7:00 PM with the core-volunteers of the event who helped in all the preparations for the event.</p>
<img alt="Group photo Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-6.jpg" />
<p>In the end, I would like to congratulate the students for making so wonderful arrangements and pushing up the FOSS community in their college. I hope they will now start landing patches in different FOSS projects &amp; we'll all meet again soon.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>GNUnify is one of the amazing event where each and every year Mozilla India community make sure to participate. GNUnify is an annual gathering consisting of Free and Open Source software workshops, talks, seminars and BOFs (Birds of a feather), hosted by the Pune Linux User Group(PLUG) and the Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research(SICSR) in Pune, India. It is an amazing opportunity for people from FOSS communities all over India to meet each other and a good chance for newbies to find out how to get involved in FOSS projects and learn more about the free and open source culture. Mozilla has been actively participating at GNUnify since 2008!</p>
<p><img alt="GNUnify tracks" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/gnunify_18.jpg" /></p>
<p>This year along with the Mozilla contributors around pune I got opportunity to organise a workshop on WebExtension at GNUnify 2018. One of the main reason for my visit is to bring some more contributors to WebExtension community and bring more webdevelopers into WebExtension development.</p>
<p>Our Mozilla track was very strong we had some many topics to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>VR session by Prathamesh</li>
<li>Marathi localization session by Narendra</li>
<li>Cook up Firefox- Privacy Settings by Ankit</li>
<li>Rust session by Mehul</li>
<li>Hardware track by Tripad</li>
<li>WebExtensions Workshop by Viswaprasath</li>
</ul>
<p>In one room we had talks and in another room I was organising workshop. It was jam packed and very tight schedule, we Mozillians were not able to talk till 3 PM.</p>
<p>I was very excitied to talk on GNUnify, from 2015 (I wanted to talk about FirefoxOS previously) I wanted to give talk there as it was one of the big event we have related to open source technologies in India. As I got opportunity this year I was very happy to delivery it there.</p>
<p>I reached the venue sharply at 9:50 and was having some discussion with volunteers about the event in past and how it grew, the story they had about this event was amazing and it gave some more energy to me. And we started my session at 10:15, I started why we need WebExtension and backgrounds of it. But 10:35 the whole lab was filled with Students and Professors (I remember talking to 3 professor at middle of session and around 50 were there).</p>
<p>After some thoughts on WebExtension I showed them the demo of my favorite extension (Youtube controller), shared the story behind it. People got excited to know why I developed it, and the next one was to search a particular word in different search engine sites.</p>
<p>Around 11:15 we started to have hands-on session. First I started explaning them explaning about manifest.json and what are all the mandatory keys and values that has to be present, once they get familiar with it I started explaning the background.js file which we coded for our ‚Äúsearch add-on‚Äù, using contextmenu. I showed the code sample with duckduckgo, but some of them understood the logic and tried to bring their favorite search engines (like Google, youtube, bing, wikipedia). Then we had a small break.  After this we developed another add-on where we will be having our own custom shortcut keys for close the tab.</p>
<p>The attendees were interested to learn more on hacking WebExtension API. One of the amazing unique thing they felt is they are able to build similar to browser internal features. They wanted to dig more and bring some amazing Extensions in future. The response from faculty and students is amazing. I had personal talk with students for more than a hour  and got chance to talk with Faculty who is handling Web Programming session. She shared it is interesting session and told she will ping back to discuss how WebExtensions can be made into their college syllabus.</p>

<p>In future I am sure, lot of amazing contributors will be coming as a effect of this event. One note which I came to know at the end of event is most of Reps from India who are present today came from this event.</p>
<p>I personally would like to thank all the Mozillians around Pune who made my day great and memorable one. Special thanks for the care shown by Prathamesh parenets, I didnt felt I am going for the first time to his home. The garden at their home is really good and well glued with nature. I am inspired a little bit by his father, may be in future will start gardening in my apartment.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>A Saturday well spent teaching students about Open Source, Add-ons and Privacy.</p>
<p>We had an activity at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)
for Addons, WoMoz and Privacy.</p>
<p>The session started with Trishul giving a talk on getting started with Add-ons.
He explained about Web Extensions and how they are useful. He also depicted some
of the extensions built by the community. He explained the use of <tt class="docutils literal">manifest</tt>
file and then students started making simple add-ons on their own. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension">borderify</a>
Web Extension was chosen to teach students. Me, Trishul and Shivam helped them
whenever they were stuck.</p>
<img alt="Web Extension session" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons.jpg" />
<p>The next session was took by Faye on Women in Mozilla and how we can improve the

    <![CDATA[<p>We recently organized Moz-Fedora Day, a one day event on promoting FOSS through
Mozilla &amp; Fedora at Investopad, Hauz Khas, Delhi on Jan 13, 2018. The aim was
to depict the usage of packaging &amp; building one of the Mozilla's project using Fedora.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam explaining about Mozilla &amp; it's mission" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-4.jpg" />
<p>The core event focused on making the participants automate the build of any of
the Mozilla's open source project of their choice. The aim is to influence
people to switch to Linux as a build environment (We used Fedora for this)
and introduce the basics of the version control system (Mercurial in case of Mozilla).
The event will also introduce to Vagrant for running standardized virtual
machines for build environments.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam engaging participants on Moz-Fedora Day" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-3.jpg" />
<p>The session began with Saurabh representing a bit about Fedora and other Linux
Distributions. I discussed about Mozilla, it's mission and different projects.
We then decided to package <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> in Fedora and guided
folks through the steps to build the system. We used simple Vagrant setup to
package Servo project with Fedora.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam explaining about build systems" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-2.jpg" />
<p>At the end of the event, we had a small discussion on how one can find bugs
through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy. The presentation can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/">http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/</a></p>
<p>We also distributed some swags to folks who were able to make builds successfully.</p>
<img alt="Swag Distribution" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-1.jpg" />
<p>Most of this was a hands-on session and I saw new faces who were truly excited to
learn about these things. A Saturday well spent, spreading the love of Open Source.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>We had <tt class="docutils literal">MozCoffee Delhi</tt> on last Saturday, Dec 23, 2017. We had a lot of Rep
Attendees this time with other Mozillians. What would have been a better way to
end an year than the MozCoffee. From past various months, the activities in
Mozilla Delhi came to a stand still. But then we had MozCoffee planned in less
than a week. Thanks to my new mentor Trishul for arranging MozCoffee at Chaayos,
Connaught Place, New Delhi on 23rd December, 2017.</p>
<p>We gathered up at the venue in the evening and met a lot of new and old people.
We had Trishul, Faye, Sanyam, Tanzeel, Dvyik, Rajiv, Saurabh, Pushpita, Shivam, Tushar at the meetup.</p>
<p>The discussion started with Trishul explaining about his experience in All Hands Austin.
He told about various projects that have been identified by Mozilla as the major
areas of contributions. We discussed about both tech &amp; non-tech contributions
in various areas.</p>
<p>Near the end of the event, Trishul also helped me in explaining about addons.
Since I've previous experience with JS, it was pretty easy to pick that stuff up.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some amazing photographs which would now become a memory for all of us.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>2017 is one of the amazing year I had. I have dedicated it fully to  learn and share my knowledge about WebExtension and develop some WebExtension during my free time.</p>
<h1 id="january">January</h1>
<p>This is one of the best month and very good start of the year. In Tamilnadu we had lot of problems but we succesfully organised our first ever MozillaTN meetup, yes we were having amazing two day event where I was helping attendees to know about WebExtension. Before even the meetup some of the attendees started learning webextension, thanks to MDN and some of the articles I wrote <img alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<h1 id="february">February</h1>
<p>This is one of the milestone month for me, I got an opportunity to share about WebExtension in our local ILUGC meetup.  ILUGC is one of the amazing community which is having the regular meetups for past 10+ years. Giving session there was really amazing and was an exciting one for me. Then at the last week I was able to visit SRM Univ after a long time and gave some basic introduction talk on WebExtension and Mozilla Community.</p>
<h1 id="march">March</h1>
<p>In march our MozillaTN community organised our first ever over night hackathon at KCG college of Technology chennai. We had 2 tracks WebVR and WebExtension. I was handling the WebExtension session and was mentoring the students on how to build it, and it is also my first hackathon with WebExtension development. Then  on the last week went to VIT chennai to share about WebExtension, It was one day session where introduced students with WebExtension and also had some coding session to develop a small addon to close the tab on click of browserAction button.</p>
<p>Between April and June sometime I was involved in developing some add-ons and wrote blog posts about them.</p>
<h1 id="july">July</h1>
<p>Went to KCG Community space and shared about WebExtension development. We had the half a session to understand about Tabs API.</p>
<p>And early July I started planning about WebExtension on-line series where planned to create vidoes and train attendes one API per day and discuss about them on how to use it for developing WebExtension.</p>
<h1 id="august">August</h1>
<p>Went Dhirajzilla engineering college at Salem and gave an introduction talk about WebExtension. The biggest gift and surprise I got from the students I was able to meet my under graduate professor there. That was the happiest moment and I was giving talk in front of my professor about WebExtension. She was amazing person and inspired us a lot, she played a major role in shaping me and my friends during our college days. And went to Sairam college to have a booth and tell students about Mozilla communities in booth and gave a short quick talk Why WebExtension are amazing.</p>
<h1 id="september">September</h1>
<p>This is one of the good month. We planned a good open hackaton (any students, employees can join) at out KCG community space. This is the first open hackathon in that community space and around 20+ attendees attended and demoed 6+ addons. Went to another hackathon at SNS College of Tech Coimbatore, where had amazing set of students with good knowledge of what they are going to develop.</p>
<h1 id="october">October</h1>
<p>SRM university approached us and wanted to have a good purely technical hands-on session. This time we had 2 days session again (my 3rd one in a row). I was showing different demo and people loved contextMenu and omnibar search and most of them showed demo on it. And they were interested in learning it continously and the guy who hosted us was amazing, thanks to Anirudh for this opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="november">November</h1>
<p>In November after a long time had opportunity to talk at over night hackathon along with Santhosh, Karthick, Trishul. It was amazing to see kids right from 13 years. Some of them showed amazing demo like text-to-speech using Web APIs. It was cool at the same time was so tired.</p>
<h1 id="december">December</h1>
<p>Yes its year end and everything is bit slow. I got opportunity to attend All hands at Austin. I met amazing Mozillians and had lot of learning. Went to awesome dinner and Star wars <img alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /><br />

  <title>Xavier Martorell - My Experience - Mozfest17</title>

    <![CDATA[<figure class="tmblr-full"><img alt="image" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/6cf02ebfcef6dd40344ded693084c9bc/tumblr_inline_ph86l1SnPO1v5cuj1_540.jpg" /></figure>



<p>Right now, I‚Äôm
on my flight back from London where I had the pleasure to assist to the Mozilla
Festival 2017. I‚Äôll try to use this 2 hours of my flight time to relate to you
how my experience was before and during it as well as the things that really
impressed me of it.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs rewind to the first beginning of the
Festival, Friday 27 at 5:00 a.m. On that time, I was just waking up after
getting only a few hours of sleep because of all the excitement I was having
for the festival, so I got dressed up as a zombie and after a really fast
breakfast that consisted on the remaining cookies of the pantry and a really
hot coffee that seemed like magma, I headed towards the airport. There, some
boring and long queues where waiting for me, as well as, the not well-received
security checkpoint where I had to take from my bag all the electronic things I
had on it (More than half of a dozen, I think the security guy got crazy when
he saw it). Finally, I made it into the plane and I headed towards London.</p>

<p>Once there, I
used all the time I had until the festival to do some sightseeing in London and
visit the typical places you usually go as a Tourist like the Big Ben, the
London Eye or the Queen‚Äôs Castle (With the famous queen‚Äôs guards on it). Also,
I tried the so famous ‚ÄúFish and Chips‚Äù.</p>

<p>After all of
this, it arrived the time, the time to go the Mozilla Festival in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p><b><i>A few
minutes later</i></b></p>

<p>I saw the Ravensbourne building after a few
minutes going around, so big, so squarish, full of strange circles on it‚Ä¶ I
went inside and I proceeded with the Check-In process where I got my Lanyard
and I went inside of it.  The first day
it was a Networking event, I didn‚Äôt really get involved with it because it was
my first Networking event ever and I felt like a fish out of water. Eventually
I got the essence of it and I started meeting some great people there like
Florian, Konstantina, Ayah, as well as, my mentor Michael.  After it, we had dinner in a nearby restaurant
and I headed back towards the hostel.
First day was over‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up, 7 a.m. After
some improvised breakfast in the hostel, I went to Ravensbourne, today it was
the day to start with the sessions. I went to sessions about confidence, others
about Privacy and also, I attended a really interesting talk about
Matrix.org.  The lunch time was also kind
of Networking so I tried to engage in different conversations with people
around me, amazing time.</p>

<p>At night, Mozilla organized a party on the
Royal Society of Arts (RSA) where there was some electronic music by a guy
dressed like Tron, with really futuristic design and music. There was also some
comedy on the Auditory, it was a great night but I headed back sooner than I
expected because I felt really tired of all day sessions.</p>

<p>Third and Last day‚Ä¶ We started the day with
a Networking Breakfast in Ravensbourne sponsored by Flattr (You should check
them out, they have great ideas). After it, I decided to go around and try the
different stuff available on it instead of going to more sessions. There, I had
the pleasure to try a great VR game about some experiments that took place in
the military, also, I got to know about The Data Detox Bar and a bunch of other
great stuff there to.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time to go, so I had to say
bye to all the people I met during the festival day and I headed to the train
(Funny story here, due to the time change, the app became crazy and it changed
my whole schedule. I decided to trust my gut and I followed my prescheduled
journey hoping to don‚Äôt lose the flight. It worked and after some crazy runs up
and down the London Bridge station, I made it into the train and I headed
towards the Airport. It was time to go back home.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>I was in high school,
sitting in the Computers room, taking part of a boring and monotonous class
about Office IT. Because of that, I decided to open Firefox and start surfing
the web for some entertainment to make the time passed faster. So, I clicked in
the Firefox logo, Firefox popped-up and as soon as it opened, I realized about of
a yellow square at the bottom of Firefox asking me to took part of Mozilla and
become a volunteer. </p>



<p>In that moment, I
was dubitative because I didn‚Äôt really know what to do or if it was worth it
but I recalled a conversation I had with my best friend at that time about
Mozilla and its principles and decided to give it a try‚Ä¶ I pressed the yellow
squared button and it redirected me into a webpage that showed me all the activities
I could join ¬†(Labs, Localization,
Coding, Marketing, QA‚Ä¶). ¬†¬†After a few minutes, I decided that I wanted
to help with QA, testing some products as Firefox Beta, Firefox Nightly or the now
ceased Firefox Aurora because I wanted to make Firefox a better browser with
less bugs and more stability. </p>



<p>Once I clicked
it, it opened my email prompting me to write an E-Mail to the responsible of QA
Area in Mozilla Hispano (who I would know later as Gabriela) stating that I
wanted to contribute in that area and the reasons for it. ¬†I wrote the email and she quickly answered it giving
me some tasks to do in Teambox (A site we used in order to organize tasks and
activities) as well as giving me some mentorship so I could start helping as
fast as possible. </p>

<p>¬†Time passed really
quick and I went from being a newcomer to be part as a member of Mozilla without
with no more mentorship. Anyway, I kept in touch with Gabriela because she was my
friend and still the responsible of the area. As time passed by, I saw a drop
in the participation of the QA area so I proposed Gabriela a new scheme for it.
She really liked the idea and she decided to offer me the possibility of being
co-responsible of the area so I could help her with all the task involved which
I clearly accepted. ¬†

</p><p>¬†A year passed
without a lot of changes, I routinely participated in the friday testdays about
Firefox Beta, we also organized an amazing Spanish testday which was
well-received and well-appreciated for the Hispanic contributors of Mozilla and
I tried to help in other areas like Marketing or Localization.

</p><p>¬†One day, I saw a
notification about a QA/Localization hackathon that would take part in Paris somewhere
near November 2015. The idea of going to Paris to the Mozilla Office really
fascinated me and I applied as fast as I could, wishing to be selected for it
so I could have the opportunity to meet other people as passionate as I for
Mozilla. Somehow, my wishes became true and I got the chance to travel to Paris
and meet some contributors there like Facyber (My great friend Marko) or
Marcia, a nice woman from Mozilla which I only had the pleasure to talk by iRC
and the one who taught us all she could about FirefoxOS in the short time of
two days. It was a really great experience.

</p><p>Sadly, one day,
Mozilla decided to cut off Firefox OS, and that decision took with it some ups
and downs which made some contributors leave the community because they didn‚Äôt
see a clear orientation or a clear focus and all the communities of Mozilla around
the world saw a big break on its activities. In that moment, I was really busy
studying for the exams of the university and other stuff so I became really inactive
for a few months and I did not really see what was coming. </p>



<p>Once I returned,
I realized how everything was stopped and I felt really guilty for it. For that
reason, some contributors and I decided that it was time to relaunch the
community and we got down to work for it. At first, we took some surveys and we
decided some goals for the community but this approach didn‚Äôt clearly work out,
so some months later, we decided to take it back and we proposed some interesting
new projects to work on and as of today, it seems it has worked because we got
new projects and new contributors working on them. </p>



<p>To conclude, I
have to add that after relaunching the community, I got really motivated so I
decided that it was time to step up and apply to become a Mozilla Rep as other
people recommended me.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It has been a long time, I have been writing here. This blog post will be about sharing my personal experience during the Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration at Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, Telangana, India.</p>
<p>I have started contributing to Mozilla way back in 2012 and I am really elated that I have come a long way. All it started when a student from BITS contacted me on Facebook asking about the activities and opportunities that a student can be benefited. I told him about the Mozilla Campus Club Program to him and he got excited about it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, I explained him about Mozilla, its mission, vision, Campus Club Program, activities and how he can be a part of a global community. And then things went fast, we decided to inaugurate a Mozilla Campus Club in their college.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that we will be inaugurating a Mozilla Club on September 1st, 2017.</p>

  <title>Abhiram Ravikumar - It‚Äôs raining Rust at Red Hat</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://abhiramrk.com/?p=322</guid>
  <link>http://abhiramrk.com/its-raining-rust-at-red-hat/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>I know it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve put out a post and mostly because I‚Äôm trying to learn amazing things and get my hands dirty, trying to build solutions that actually make sense.</p>
<p>One such pet-project has been Rust, probably the <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/06/08/language-rankings-6-17/">fastest</a> growing systems level programming language today. Hitherto, I‚Äôve always looked at Rust from the outside, never got my hands dirty, mostly because I was under the assumption that it had nothing to do with web development. Turns out, I was completely wrong!</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/rainofrust-campaign-trailer/15852">Rain of Rust</a> campaign gave me an opportunity to revisit the programming language and the reason why it‚Äôs been garnering interests at astronomical pace. For a nascent programming language which is in the 1.19th version of its release, it‚Äôs challenging the big guns ‚Äì C and C++. Yes, you heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why">it </a>right.</p>
<h3>On to the campaign</h3>
<p>The campaign, although initiated and led by volunteers from the Mozilla India community at first was later adopted by the larger Mozilla community with contributions from all over the world like these events in <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-activate/">Mexico </a>and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/dive-into-rust-senai-santa-cecilia/">Brazil</a>. The main goal of the event was to increase outreach about the language and train developers to contribute in the rust ecosystem.</p>
<h3>At Bangalore</h3>
<p>As one of the crucial aspects of the campaign was to organize on-the-ground events and so, with the gracious support of our host Sumantro at Red Hat, we managed to pull of a small event consisting of rust enthusiasts and Mozilla Tech Speakers.</p>
<p>We had our very own Vigneshwer leading the introduction to rust and hands-on session. This was well taken by the participants who had just installed rust and exploring what they could do with the language.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have <a href="https://twitter.com/dvigneshwer">@dvigneshwer</a> today kick starting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RainOfRust?src=hash">#RainOfRust</a>  at BLR. <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang">@rustlang</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mozTechSpeakers">@mozTechSpeakers</a> <img alt="üåü" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f31f.png" style="height: 1em;" /> other talks lined up.. <a href="https://t.co/EGvXB63sS3">pic.twitter.com/EGvXB63sS3</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>With witty remarks, use cases and insights of the language,¬†Vigneshwer kept the participants interested. During the hands-on he introduced the <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits">kits </a>built by the Rust India community and explained how participants could use them to learn the language. On the whole, it was a well-rounded session and helped the participants understand why rust is important and how they could contribute.</p>
<p>We then had a talk by Ravi from <a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/">Ather energy</a>¬†which has used rust components to send ¬†location data packets from its two-wheeler vehicles to the cloud in a secure and reliable fashion. His talk was inspirational as the participants were able to visualize how rust could be used in a production scenario.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For the last talk of the day, we had our own ReMo and host Sumantro show a demo on <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, a simple web framework for rust developers. This was in particular interest to me as a web developer, hitherto I was under the impression that rust could only be used for parallel computing and system level programming scenarios. ¬†Now that I know rust has a fast and safe web framework, watch out JavaScript! Here‚Äôs Sumantro‚Äôs¬†<a href="http://sumantrom.blogspot.in/2017/04/rocket-on-fedora.html">post </a>on how to set it up on Fedora.</p>
<div class="fb-social-plugin fb-post"></div>
<p>¬†</p>
<h3>Last word</h3>
<p>On the whole it was personally fulfilling that we pulled off a workshop in ~1 week of planning and what was comforting was that the feedback we received through the new ReMo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/activate.mozilla.community/issues/210">feedback form</a> was a 6+ on a scale of 0-7. Yay!</p>
<p>Finishing off with a mighty group photo. A round of shout-outs to Bhumika and Ra Fey for helping us out with the posters and social media calls to action! You guys are wonderful. ^_^</p>

  <title>Sanyam Khurana - Why you should contribute to Open Source</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.sanyamkhurana.com,2017-06-26:blog/why-contribute-to-foss.html</guid>
  <link>https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/why-contribute-to-foss.html</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>My first step with FOSS was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/how-dgplug-training-is-proving-beneficial-to-me.html">during the summer of 2014</a>, where I got introduced to <a class="reference external" href="http://dgplug.org">DGPLUG</a> (Durgapur Linux Users Group). Every year, they conduct a training over IRC covering a wide range of topics. Since then, I've been contributing to different projects, primarily to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">Mozilla's Gecko Engine</a>. Recently I also started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr%20author%3ACuriousLearner">contributing to CPython</a>.</p>
<p>Over <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CuriousLearner/">this journey as CuriousLearner over the past few years</a>, I've been fortunate enough to collaborate with some of the best engineers, learnt a lot of skills &amp; gained some nice perspective on different technologies by just contributing to Open Source. I owe my learning to them.</p>
<p>I've been always asked this question by my friends, colleagues, and strangers whom I often run into in local meet-ups and conferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why should I contribute to Open Source</li>
<li>What's in it for me</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I thought I would cover this topic from the perspective of a student as well as the perspective of a working professional.</p>
<div class="section" id="learn-new-skills">
<h2>Learn new skills</h2>
<p>When I say skills, I'm not referring to just coding skills or learning yet another framework. There are tons of skills to be learnt. These include coding, debugging, testing, writing docs, collaboration, participating in meetings etc. In FOSS, you won't just learn technical skills, but soft skills as well. That means you'll learn how to communicate effectively over different mediums and making sense to other people who might be from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>I've seen many engineers are hesitant when it comes to communication. They can think and write really nice code, but when it comes to explaining themselves, they lack the communication skills, which is vital to be a better professional.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improve-existing-skills">
<h2>Improve existing skills</h2>
<p>It's not always about learning a new tech that you heard about. It's important to improve on things you think <em>you might already know</em>. Contributing to a FOSS project would make you learn intricate details that your mentors have gained working as a software craftsmen for several years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meet-like-minded-people">
<h2>Meet like-minded people</h2>
<p>Many organizations do stand-up / all-hands meetings where everyone comes together and explains what are they're working on, what they plan to do next and if they face any blocker. So, students, there is a high possibility that when you graduate, you'll do this in your organization :) You'll meet a lot of people having similar interests and you'll learn a lot of things just by hanging out with them (most of the time on IRC).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-people-skills">
<h2>Learn people skills</h2>
<p>Learn team management, resolving internal conflicts, brainstorming on a new feature, public-speaking, time-management, conducting meet-ups &amp; learn to prioritize your work. You will just expand your horizons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-to-read">
<h2>Learn to READ</h2>
<p>One of the best things I've been ever taught is to "READ". (And those who've met me personally knows how many times I've been repeating this thing :)).</p>
<p>When I say read, I mean you'll read the documentation, development guide and most importantly the source code.</p>
<p>Always remember that code is meant to be read more times than it is written. When you contribute to any FOSS project, one of the important skill you add to your skill-set is to make your brain make sense out of the code that may look gibberish to many people.</p>
<p>This is a very important skill. Once you're in a company, you'll be given the responsibility of maintaining huge code base and constantly adding features to it. There won't be someone who would spoon-feed you by explaining what every line of code means.</p>
<p>I've seen many people struggling hard in their jobs to figure out what a particular piece of code does. But if you've already worked with humongous code bases, this shall be a cake-walk for you. You would already know how to scrutinize bugs, debug errors and most importantly, would have already taught your brain to think and <cite>READ</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-mentors">
<h2>Find mentors</h2>
<p>FOSS is all about mentors &amp; mentees. There are people just like me and you who volunteer their time and skill to do good for the community. You'll find a lot of mentors who would be willing to teach you different skills. Remember, that you've got this opportunity to learn from domain experts :)</p>
<p>And no matter what, always respect everyone's time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teach-others">
<h2>Teach others</h2>
<p>While it is important to get your code reviewed, it is much more important to review other's code. This would help you in learning different coding style and also about how someone approached a particular problem. This would help in expanding your logical skills &amp; as always you'll be learning a lot yourself along the way with having healthy discussions in code reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-feels-great-to-make-small-changes">
<h2>It feels great to make (small) changes</h2>
<p>You don't necessarily need to work on big features in a project or become a life-long contributor. Contribute to a project that you use on daily basis (like <a class="reference external" href="https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">Mozilla Firefox</a>) and I promise you that it would be gratifying when you see the whole world rely on the small code changes you did.</p>
<p>A small change in the documentation means you might save someone countless hours of debugging and scratching their head on how to use a particular piece of code. Always remember, documentation bugs are not something inferior; you'll learn a lot in writing documentation, right from the tools such as Sphinx and rST to expanding your domain knowledge about the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-your-reputation-career-along-the-way">
<h2>Building your reputation (&amp; career) along the way</h2>
<p>All the code you'll write in Open Source projects would be public and can be taken as a demonstration of how you write code &amp; what you can do. It depicts how you work with others and most importantly give you an enormous amount of experience in working with people having diversified skill-set.</p>
<p>Once you get acquainted with the code base, you'll be invited to develop stand-alone features and who knows you might get that commit bit turned on when you've developed enough reputation in the community ;)</p>
<p>Apart from all the things mentioned above, I think Mozilla's mission says a lot about why I contribute to FOSS</p>
<blockquote>
Doing good is part of our code</blockquote>
<p>Alright, I didn't realize, I'll be able to write this much. Hopefully, this would help &amp; motivate people to get involved in contributing to Open Source. As always, if you have any queries, or want help in contributing to any project, feel free to mail me on <strong>Sanyam [at] SanyamKhurana [dot] com</strong>.</p>
