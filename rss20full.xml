  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - Virtual Reality @ Hackfest, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>HackFest is IIT(ISM) Dhanbad’s 36-hour annual hackathon organized by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) and ACM Student Chapter, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.</p>
<p>The event started with an introduction of speakers. <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh</a>, <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/umesh/">Umesh</a>, and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahbaz/">Shahbaz</a> ( yep it’s me ), since we had limited time with us. So it was a quick talk-demo-workshop.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232299546" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232299546.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Prathamesh started with his favorite virtual girlfriend story to explain the concept of  Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. After a long and tiring hackathon, the audience seems interested and was into it.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232272809" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1015" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232272809.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>I talked about the basics of WebVR, why we brought the VR on Web and what are their advantages. Used Kevin’s presentation for explaining the concept in details with his amazing presentation (<a href="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/" rel="nofollow">https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining what WebVR is, we asked participants to visit <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="nofollow">https://aframe.io/</a> and remix the hello world example on  <a href="http://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://glitch.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>Due to the limited amount of time, participants couldn’t finish their idea. So we gave them a contest, where top 5 scenes will get a surprise gift from us.</p>
<p>And here comes, what we love most. After event photograph with the participants.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>WebMR is a new technology which is in its initial stages. WebMR was the thing which has brought a huge participation at Baroda.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly waiting for us. Event started with a brief introduction of the speakers. Prathamesh Chavan and I talked about our love to open source.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_103016_bokeh/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_103016_bokeh.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_095537/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_095537.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>

<p>Prathamesh talked about the differences of WebVR WebAR and WebMR. His way of relating things to virtual girlfriend has brought a new spark in attendees.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_134118" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1003" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_134118.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I talked about basics of Virtual reality and why we have brought the VR on Web. And how easy it is to code and experience the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_145209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1001" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_145209.jpg?w=788" /><br />
<img alt="IMG_20180224_093838" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1008" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_093838.jpg?w=788" /><img alt="IMG_20180224_103742" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1005" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_103742.jpg?w=788" /><br />
Lunch time, we went to Nosh Farmaiye, best place in town for chicken kebabs. Must place to visit when you’re in town.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_123451" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1004" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_123451.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>After the lunch we started the hand-on session of WebVR . And to do so nothing is better than a hello world example. We have used glitch to live demo the scenes.</p>
<p>First day concluded with the prize distribution to the top 5 teams.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180225_085802" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180225_085802.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Second day started with WebAR, I explained the differences and similarities in AR and VR. Here again started with hello world example using hero marker.<br />
And talked about new features of AR and VR.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_160339/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_160339.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_142250/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_142250.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>

<p>Definitely one day we would do a full session on WebMR.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>We all know that every year, 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day. It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights. On this occasion, all the Open Source communities in and around Delhi came forward to hold a mega-meetup to encourage more women to take active part in Open Source &amp; Tech on March 10, 2018.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>It all started with PyCon India. I met a few students of Aligarh Muslim University who were trying to teach about FOSS in their college. A few them were already contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">Coala</a>. We talked a bit and they were discussing problems they were facing to run that community. I already started a Mozilla community at my college in the earlier days. Since I brought up a lot of folks from my college community in the event, we together discussed <em>How to nurture FOSS communities in college</em> as part of PyCon India Open Spaces. Here is a glimpse of the same:</p>

<p>Later, these folks were excited and invited me as a speaker at their college. A lot of planning happened for the event and we were in touch almost daily for different things. We planned the event one and a half month in advance. Finally, on 24th Feb 2018, we decided to have a full-day event around FOSS at Aligarh Muslim University.</p>
<p>We left from Delhi at around 6:30 AM in the morning. We then halted at a cafe known as <cite>Break Point</cite> around Aligarh to have breakfast. We reached the university at around 10:20 AM.</p>
<p>We took some time to test the entire set-up and the event began at around 11:30 AM. I took the first session on <strong>Why you should contribute to Open Source</strong>. We discussed the question that somehow pops up sooner or later into everyone's mind while contributing to Open Source: <strong>What's in it for me?</strong>.</p>
<p>We discussed various pathways one can begin contributing to Open Source Projects like <strong>coding, writing docs, managing team, advocacy, documentation, translation, bug triaging, reviews, organization skills, soft skills</strong> &amp; tons of other things that come as a by-product.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning about different contribution pathways in FOSS" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-9.jpg" />
<p>You can find the slides here: <a class="reference external" href="http://sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/why-foss">Why you should contribute to Open Source?</a>.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-2.jpg" />
<p>We had a break for sometime and then started with the much awaited <strong>Add-ons session</strong>. Everyone was very excited to start learning to develop add-ons. I began with explaining the initial setup details &amp; discussed JSON briefly to bring everyone on the same page. To make most out of the event, We also organized a few events previously to teach basics of JavaScript &amp; JSON so that students so that they do not feel overwhelmed with the add-ons development.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-3.jpg" />
<p>Then Shashank (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/realslimshanky">@realslimshanky</a>) took over and discussed <tt class="docutils literal">manifest.json</tt> and it's importance. Later we developed a simple addon -- borderify, which displays a border on every site the user visits. Some students also modified their scripts to make their add-ons do different things and posted them on twitter. Shashank, me and Shivam Singhal (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/championshuttler">@championshuttler</a>) helped everyone with their problems during the development phase.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-4.jpg" />
<p>Since all of us are devs, we were able to quickly resolve queries of students. One of the most important things I noticed is that often people misspell either the name of their manifest file or some key in their manifest people resulting their add-on to not load during the debugging phase.</p>
<p>A lot of them then created addons on their own and modified their previously created borderify addon to do more stuff. I've tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/CuriousLearner/1a4b08dbf642be8e4dfeb9544c9ab4c9">collect some of them here</a>. For a more verbose list you can visit Twitter and search tweets tagging me (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">@ErSanyamKhurana</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozAMU">#MozAMU</a>.</p>
<p>Imaginations ran wild and one of the attendee created an addon that replaces the word <tt class="docutils literal">Google</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">Mozilla</tt> on every web page. You can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/husainhz7/GoogleMozilla/">his hack here</a></p>
<p>To make the session more interesting we gave add-ons stickers to anyone who answers the question about what we were just telling them. A lot of folks praised and tweeted about the addons they were generating. We were able to generate <strong>10,000+ impressions with more than 4,000+ accounts reached on Twitter for #MozAMU</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on no of impressions created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-11.png" />
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on top contributors created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-12.png" />
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="https://tweetreach.com/reports/20714737">read the full report here</a>.</p>
<p>Till this time, I never introduced to anyone about who am I and most importantly not listed any of my contributions in any of the projects. I don't want them to feel overwhelmed and assume that we people have some sort of superpowers that we're able to patch bugs in any FOSS project. I always make it a point to encourage them and help them land their first patch.</p>
<p>And my introduction summed that up in just one line <tt class="docutils literal">I'm one of you <span class="pre">--</span> a part of the community</tt>.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner) teaching about essential things to learn while contributing to FOSS projects" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-13.png" />
<p>We then hopped on to discuss <strong>How do I start contributing to Open Source?</strong> where we specifically discussed <strong>How to find bugs on different projects through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Enthusiastic folks learning about contributions for Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-7.jpg" />
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/#/">slides here</a>. Then I discussed other Open Source projects I've contributed to like <em>CPython, Django, Oppia, Mozilla's Devtools, Gecko-Engine &amp; tried to find out similarities in various bug trackers.</em> We then had a group photo with some of the attendees.</p>
<img alt="Group photo at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-5.jpg" />
<p>It was already 5 PM and we didn't go for Lunch since students kept us busy with their questions during the lunch break too :P</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic students asking questions in break" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-8.jpg" />
<p>So, we decided to hop-on to a restaurant nearby with the core-team of students that helped in organizing the event with so much enthusiasm.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-10.jpg" />
<p>Then we clicked one last photo before leaving Aligarh at around 7:00 PM with the core-volunteers of the event who helped in all the preparations for the event.</p>
<img alt="Group photo Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-6.jpg" />
<p>In the end, I would like to congratulate the students for making so wonderful arrangements and pushing up the FOSS community in their college. I hope they will now start landing patches in different FOSS projects &amp; we'll all meet again soon.</p>]]>

<p>In my every event I am always seeking for feedback’s from participants/attendees/visitors, doesn’t matter its positive or negative because if you know the feedback you can definitely work on it to improve for next time to make it better.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Feedback important?</strong> so I believe Feedback <span class="_Tgc _s8w">allows us to build and maintain communication with others and t</span>he most important information collected from post-event surveys is whether attendees found value in the event, whether it was worth their investment of time and resources, and whether they would participate in the event again.</p>

<p>The Squad for <strong>#MakerFest2018</strong> made sure people knew about the Web they are in, and how fast and far they can go if they go together. Often questioned, why are we doing this? We let them know that we are mere volunteers who are working to make the huge Web we are a part of, a healthier and a better place to be in! <img alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2764.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

    <![CDATA[<p><span class="author-a-z82zz66zom553pz122zz88z4az65zfz84ze"><a href="https://girlscriptsummit.tech/"><strong>GirlScript India Summit</strong></a> – It is the first ever women oriented technical festival of India hosted by GirlScript Foundation. It is a platform where students get a chance to polish their skills and explore their potential. The Technical fest will comprise of Events, Exhibitions, Guest Lectures and a lot more, which aims to provide holistic exposure to students.</span></p>
<p>The India Summit will cover the highlights of ‘Technical Industry’ such as AI and Advanced Machine Learning, Intelligent Apps (Virtual Personal Assistance), Intelligent Things (Robots, Drones, and Autonomous Vehicles), Virtual and Augmented Reality, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.

<p><span class="author-a-z82zz66zom553pz122zz88z4az65zfz84ze"><strong>Goal:</strong> Introduce <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, WebVR with enthusiastic students, experts who came at this summit. Also, It is a 2-day event that comprises of students from different universities across the country. Moreover, It is a platform where students get a chance to polish their skills and explore their potential. The Technical fest will comprise of Events, Exhibitions, Guest Lectures and a lot more, which aims to provide holistic exposure to students.</span><span id="more-1488"></span></p>
<p>Being Mozillian,  I believed that this event has a good potential to spread Mozilla mission so <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/girlscript-india-summit/">Mozilla Reps</a> have supported the event by giving a talk on Rust &amp; WebVR which are the most emerging technologies nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">Started my talk by introducing them to Rust and why I’m using Rust? I believe, Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages. It also gives a relatively familiar tool to the modern C++ developers, but in the much more consistent and reliable ways.</span></p>
<p>I believe, new system programming language solves a lot of common system programming bugs. Moreover here we have Cargo: Rust Package manager which helps to Improve your toolkit. And, Its best for Self-learning &amp; always have fun to do.</p>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/rusthacks/RustHack/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits.</a></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>As you already know from our discourse topic, we have created an Onboarding Screening Team.</p>
<p>The scope of this team is to help on evaluating the new applications to the Reps program by helping the Reps Council on this process.</p>
<p>In January we opened a call for the new team members on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/do-you-want-join-the-onboarding-screening-team/24497">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/do-you-want-join-the-onboarding-screening-team/24497</a></p>
<p>We were happily surprised with the number of applications we’ve got.</p>
<p>After a month the Reps Council has voted and has chosen the new members. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mad_Maks/">Tim Maks van den Broek</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/vi5halc/">Vishal Chavan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/akayannick98/">Aka Brou Yannick N</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/gmontagu/">Gabriela Montagu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On behalf of the Reps Council (and part of this team) I want to say thank you to the previous team that worked on 9 rounds of screening with evaluation of 39 applications.</p>
<p>These amazing people are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/michaelkohler/">Michael Kohler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mijanur/">Mijanur Rahman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mte90/">Daniele Scasciafratte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/hossainalikram/">Hossain Al Ikram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The new team will start to work soon (we have about 10 applications in queue) with the help of a Reps Council Member that will be focused on communications between applicants and the evaluation of this team.</p>
<p>If you want to congratulate your fellows Reps you can do it in this thread:</p>

<p>This time I’m going to change my blog style and going to include some real-time tweets which can get through about, how the complete session went. So, Let’s find out.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Started my talk by introducing them to Rust and why I’m using Rust? I believe, Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages. It also gives a relatively familiar tool to the modern C++ developers, but in the much more consistent and reliable ways.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener"><b>Rust</b> </a>is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. But, in my opinion, “<em>Rust is a good choice when you’d choose C++. You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.”</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Normally</em> people became ‘<em>lazy</em>‘ or ‘<em>sleepy</em>‘ after having lunch and moreover, if you get delicious Gujarati food then you can’t resist yourself to have. Upon that my talk was the first in line after lunch break so to having that in mind I have changed my talk style and from the start only I have tried to make the session interactive so the audience can also be part and their mind can be diverted. Guess what, It worked and people loved the interaction period. All an all we have a very healthy conversation during the session.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>A Saturday well spent teaching students about Open Source, Add-ons and Privacy.</p>
<p>We had an activity at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)
for Addons, WoMoz and Privacy.</p>
<p>The session started with Trishul giving a talk on getting started with Add-ons.
He explained about Web Extensions and how they are useful. He also depicted some
of the extensions built by the community. He explained the use of <tt class="docutils literal">manifest</tt>
file and then students started making simple add-ons on their own. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension">borderify</a>
Web Extension was chosen to teach students. Me, Trishul and Shivam helped them
whenever they were stuck.</p>

  <title>Sanyam Khurana - Moz-Fedora Day</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">tag:SanyamKhurana.com,2018-01-14:blog/moz-fedora-day.html</guid>
  <link>http://SanyamKhurana.com/blog/moz-fedora-day.html</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>We recently organized Moz-Fedora Day, a one day event on promoting FOSS through
Mozilla &amp; Fedora at Investopad, Hauz Khas, Delhi on Jan 13, 2018. The aim was
to depict the usage of packaging &amp; building one of the Mozilla's project using Fedora.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam explaining about Mozilla &amp; it's mission" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-4.jpg" />
<p>The core event focused on making the participants automate the build of any of
the Mozilla's open source project of their choice. The aim is to influence
people to switch to Linux as a build environment (We used Fedora for this)
and introduce the basics of the version control system (Mercurial in case of Mozilla).
The event will also introduce to Vagrant for running standardized virtual
machines for build environments.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam engaging participants on Moz-Fedora Day" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-3.jpg" />
<p>The session began with Saurabh representing a bit about Fedora and other Linux
Distributions. I discussed about Mozilla, it's mission and different projects.
We then decided to package <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> in Fedora and guided
folks through the steps to build the system. We used simple Vagrant setup to
package Servo project with Fedora.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam explaining about build systems" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-2.jpg" />
<p>At the end of the event, we had a small discussion on how one can find bugs
through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy. The presentation can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/">http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/</a></p>
<p>We also distributed some swags to folks who were able to make builds successfully.</p>
<img alt="Swag Distribution" src="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-1.jpg" />
<p>Most of this was a hands-on session and I saw new faces who were truly excited to
learn about these things. A Saturday well spent, spreading the love of Open Source.</p>]]>

  <title>Michal Stanke - Mozilla.cz 2017 recap</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://michal.stanke.cz/2018/01/14/mozilla-cz-2017-recap</guid>
  <link>https://michal.stanke.cz/2018/01/14/mozilla-cz-2017-recap.html</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>This week I have published a <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/zpravicky/ohlednuti-za-rokem-2017/">recapitulation of the last year</a>, how we did in 2017 and how we would like to continue in 2018. It was rather a short article in Czech and I would like to elaborate more here for the global Mozilla community.</p>

<p>In the last year we have attended more conferences than I realized. I was surprised when counting them before writing the post, and if I counted right, the final number is eight, plus a secondary school. Btw. did you know we started meetups too? Yes, we did! We call them MozBeers and so far we had them in Prague and Brno, the two largest cities in the Czech Republic. True, our MozBeers are not happening regularly, but we have them. Also I need to highlight we never gathered in the full count on any place, nor meetups nor conferences, but thanks we were able to share our experience and ideas, everything went smooth.</p>

<p>Localization became our natural activity we do not even have to plan or organize much. We have localized both versions of Firefox Focus for Android and iOS (kudos to Michal Vašíček and the rest of the team), all the new Tet Pilot experiments, and Firefox Quantum of course! I don’t want to boast, but retrospectively I think we could do even twice as much l10n work without even noticing.</p>

<p>After such year I am pretty positive about our community traction. There are new faces around and I feel much less pressure on myself, which was not the case a year ago. Despite we still s**k in our communication in the direction outside, I see this improving in the last months. We have created a Telegram channel as an open channel to reach us in a completely informal way for all the Czech users and the broader community. Plus we have got <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/sumo/2018/01/13/the-big-sumo-report-2017/">Czech in the social support tool</a>. @firefox now speaks Czech too! I hope we can improve in the area of communication in 2018 even more.</p>

<p>There are several priority goals we are already decided to do in 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go through all the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&amp;namedcmd=Open%20[cs]%20bugs">terminology bugs and questions</a> we have filed on ourselves and resolve them.</li>
  <li>Write a localization style guide. This is a long overdue task.</li>
  <li>Finish all other, mostly technical <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/ukoly/">tasks</a> we have.</li>
  <li>Get Firefox.cz and Mozilla.cz in a new dress. No promises on this, but it seems to happen soonish.</li>
  <li>Build a strategy for regular and interesting content for Mozilla.cz. This will be a tough one.</li>
  <li>Show ourselves everywhere possible. ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>You already see there is plenty for us to do. I could barely complete a half of these tasks only myself, but I see them as a peace of cake being surrounded by the army of awesome Mozillians!</p>]]>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - Reps Council at Austin</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/?p=522</guid>
  <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2018/01/11/reps-council-at-austin/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><em>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco"> All Hands Wiki page</a> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about what 2018 planning. One of our main topics was about the Mission Driven Mozillians proposal.</em></p>
<h2>Hot Topics</h2>
<p>As you already know, we asked in the past for your input on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/your-input-on-open-questions-for-mission-driven-mozillians-project/22388/">discourse</a> (if you’re not already subscribed to the Reps category, maybe now it’s the right moment)</p>
<p>Before we start with the recap of the week, we would like to say thank you to the Reps that left feedbacks on that thread (Felipe, Edoardo and André) but also all to the Mozillians on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/</a> that left their feedbacks too.</p>
<p>These suggestions were very important and on shaping the document that will be available soon (we had more discussions during the All Hands so the new revised version is not yet ready).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.18.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-524" height="252" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.18-252x252.jpg" width="252" /></a></p>
<p>Mission Driven Mozillians was the major topic on the Reps Council meetings. After consulting the results of Communities and Contributors Qualitative Survey we shaped the following questions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Reps program really a representative of all the mozillian communities?</li>
<li>How does the program need to evolve to engage more with our members?</li>
<li>How can we get new Reps to join the new Coach and Resources initiatives?</li>
<li>How can we improve the use of the report tool by our Reps?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plans for 2018</h2>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_523"><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/austin.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-523" height="336" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/austin-252x336.jpg" width="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A photo with: Reps Peers, Reps Council (missing Prathamesh and Elio), Kiki (the awesome girl that manage all our budget/swag requests) and Manel (an unexpected guest during the photo shoot)</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving forward, our plan is to deep dive into those because and also start acting on them.</p>
<p>The council also highly engaged with the Leadership proposal (that had a high priority) since it will be the base on how Mozilla communities will be shaped in the near future and will of course influence our program.</p>
<p>Open by Design was the motto of this All Hands during all the meetings inside Open Innovation, but also across the organization. You see Mozilla has a strong value that the other IT companies don’t have: the community.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_525"><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.24.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-525" height="252" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.24-252x252.jpg" width="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla is more than a Silicon Valley IT company</p></div>
<p>One of the most curious and interesting, for the purpose of openness, thing is the ability to access  official Mozilla Slack channels for all the mozillians with NDA to. This support enables the volunteers to be able to communicate directly with the employees. And Yes, as Reps you have already signed the NDA so you can access without problems the various channels!</p>]]>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>We had <tt class="docutils literal">MozCoffee Delhi</tt> on last Saturday, Dec 23, 2017. We had a lot of Rep
Attendees this time with other Mozillians. What would have been a better way to
end an year than the MozCoffee. From past various months, the activities in
Mozilla Delhi came to a stand still. But then we had MozCoffee planned in less
than a week. Thanks to my new mentor Trishul for arranging MozCoffee at Chaayos,
Connaught Place, New Delhi on 23rd December, 2017.</p>
<p>We gathered up at the venue in the evening and met a lot of new and old people.
We had Trishul, Faye, Sanyam, Tanzeel, Dvyik, Rajiv, Saurabh, Pushpita, Shivam, Tushar at the meetup.</p>
<p>The discussion started with Trishul explaining about his experience in All Hands Austin.
He told about various projects that have been identified by Mozilla as the major
areas of contributions. We discussed about both tech &amp; non-tech contributions
in various areas.</p>
<p>Near the end of the event, Trishul also helped me in explaining about addons.
Since I've previous experience with JS, it was pretty easy to pick that stuff up.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some amazing photographs which would now become a memory for all of us.</p>

Ce nouveau modèle d’extensions multinavigateur était devenu exclusif dans Firefox quelques jours plus tôt. Une soirée de présentation a précédé la journée de programmation de ces extensions.</p>
<p>Pour préparer le hackathon, il fallait une soirée de lancement.</p>    <p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/conf-meetup.jpg" title="Salle conférence à Mozilla Paris"><img alt="Salle conférence à Mozilla Paris" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.conf-meetup_m.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></a></p>

<p>Ce hackathon sous le signe du portage et de la migration des extensions a été introduit par deux présentations.</p>

<p>Tout d’abord, notre Mozillien Christophe Villeneuve a montré comment porter les extensions développées pour Chrome vers Firefox. Il a listé les erreurs couramment rencontrées lors de ces opérations. Vous pouvez retrouver ses diapos (<i lang="en">slides</i>) :</p>

<p>Ensuite, Marc de <a href="https://www.lilo.org/fr/" hreflang="fr" title="Lilo moteur de recherche">Lilo</a> a partagé son expérience dans le développement d’extensions pour un moteur de recherche « qui finance des projets sociaux et environnementaux ». Il a justifié ses choix techniques face aux  contraintes de son service et des navigateurs pris en charge.</p>

<p>Enfin, il a été temps pour les participants de proposer leurs envies, manques, besoin aux <i lang="en">hackers</i> du lendemain.</p>

<p><img alt="idées pour le hackathon" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.idees_m.jpg" style="display: table; margin: 0 auto;" /><br />
<em style="display: block; text-align: center;">Extrait des idées des participants</em></p>

<p>Après une courte nuit, les participants sont revenus avec beaucoup d’idées suite aux différentes conversations de la veille.</p>

<p>Au cours de la journée, les développements ont été très variés, avec une pause en milieu de journée pour reprendre des forces. Voici une petite liste des projets en cours établie en fin de journée :</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/midi.jpg"><img alt="repas du midi" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.midi_m.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 150px;" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Tamper proxy (anciennement Tamper Data) : monitoring de requête</li>
<li>Top Word  : un outil pour analyser le nombre de mots employés dans une page et les classer</li>
<li>Aria Liner : une extension d’accessibilité</li>
<li>Un cloneur de contenu</li>
<li>Une extension pour communiquer avec le site liveslide.io</li>
<li>DevTools PHP : un débogueur PHP dans la console</li>
</ul>

<p>Ce fut l’occasion pour les participants d’apprendre à créer les extensions. Ils vont continuer le développement pour pouvoir les mettre prochainement dans le <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/" hreflang="fr" title="Site des extensions de Firefox">dépôt site des extensions</a> de Mozilla.</p>

<p>Nous sommes sûrs que certains projets verront le jour très rapidement.</p>

<p>En outre, les idées proposées et non retenues ne sont pas perdues. Elles ont été envoyées sur le <a href="https://github.com/firefox-addons/ideas/issues" hreflang="en" title="dépôt communautaire des extensions">dépôt communautaire</a>. La communauté des extensions pourra s’en inspirer pour en réaliser une.</p>

<p>Après ce marathon, les organisateurs ont reçu des demandes pour refaire un événement de ce type. Ils ont été sensibles à cette forte demande… Ce sera pour 2018. Alors, à suivre…</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Event was the follow-up of <a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/">MozAarambh</a> . Students were very much excited to know about the Virtual reality  in our previous event. So we went again with A-frame and WebVR through WebVR Camp.</p>

<p>Event started with a warm welcome and introduction of WebVR. We have distributed Aframe postcards , thanks for the wonderful cheatsheet, to all the attendees so that they get to know about Aframe and WebVR in detail and how to get involved in it. With the brief walkthrough of agenda we went to the Computer Lab where the actual fun begun.</p>

<p>We started with the hello world example of A-frame, later everyone was able to mix and make their own hello world .</p>

<p>All the projects developed during this event need few finishing after that we’ll be hosting them to a central repository. We are happy to see great ethusiasm among the students of Jharkhand Rai University, got to know more about the problems they had earlier too, I hope I’ll be able to fix few of them and with the support of the community we’ll make this Jharkhand community a productive one.</p>

  <title>Michal Stanke - Pontoon Tools 3.0</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://michal.stanke.cz/2017/11/12/pontoon-tools-3-0</guid>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>After 150 commits in total, Pontoon Tools got a third major release 3.0! From now on, post-installation/update tour will show you the most important features in Pontoon Tools. So this time for the last time probably (and shortly) what’s new in the new and still shiny Pontoon Tools 3.0.</p>

<p>As noted, there is a new introduction tour listing all major features of Pontoon Tools. It will appear after first installation or major version update. You can guess where I took inspiration for its design. Please check it carefully, as there may be feature you were not aware of before. ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://michal.stanke.cz/assets/img/pontoon-tools-intro.jpg" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img alt="Pontoon Tools introduction tour" src="https://michal.stanke.cz/assets/img/pontoon-tools-intro.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Also a completely new feature arrived, which are system notifications. Pontoon Tools can now utilize the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Notifications">notifications API</a> to inform you about new unread notifications in Pontoon. Because I understand not everyone must be happy with something popping up in the system, this feature is disabled by default and the introduction tour will allow you to enable it quickly.</p>

<p>And last but not least, I have unified the toolbar button popup style with Pontoon itself, and added short information about last team activity. The complete list of all the small improvements, including those on background, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/releases/tag/v3.0">release notes</a>. If you are not using Pontoon Tools yet, your can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pontoon-tools/">install them into your Firefox from AMO</a>.</p>]]>

  <title>Xavier Martorell - My Experience - Mozfest17</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://yunit0.tumblr.com/post/167299502492</guid>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="image" src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/4f52a680f2ac26f7016bc4b36471b4a3/tumblr_inline_oz59yiouWu1v5cuj1_540.jpg" />



<p>Right now, I’m
on my flight back from London where I had the pleasure to assist to the Mozilla
Festival 2017. I’ll try to use this 2 hours of my flight time to relate to you
how my experience was before and during it as well as the things that really
impressed me of it.</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to the first beginning of the
Festival, Friday 27 at 5:00 a.m. On that time, I was just waking up after
getting only a few hours of sleep because of all the excitement I was having
for the festival, so I got dressed up as a zombie and after a really fast
breakfast that consisted on the remaining cookies of the pantry and a really
hot coffee that seemed like magma, I headed towards the airport. There, some
boring and long queues where waiting for me, as well as, the not well-received
security checkpoint where I had to take from my bag all the electronic things I
had on it (More than half of a dozen, I think the security guy got crazy when
he saw it). Finally, I made it into the plane and I headed towards London.</p>

<p>Once there, I
used all the time I had until the festival to do some sightseeing in London and
visit the typical places you usually go as a Tourist like the Big Ben, the
London Eye or the Queen’s Castle (With the famous queen’s guards on it). Also,
I tried the so famous “Fish and Chips”.</p>

<p>After all of
this, it arrived the time, the time to go the Mozilla Festival in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p><b><i>A few
minutes later</i></b></p>

<p>I saw the Ravensbourne building after a few
minutes going around, so big, so squarish, full of strange circles on it… I
went inside and I proceeded with the Check-In process where I got my Lanyard
and I went inside of it.  The first day
it was a Networking event, I didn’t really get involved with it because it was
my first Networking event ever and I felt like a fish out of water. Eventually
I got the essence of it and I started meeting some great people there like
Florian, Konstantina, Ayah, as well as, my mentor Michael.  After it, we had dinner in a nearby restaurant
and I headed back towards the hostel.
First day was over…</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up, 7 a.m. After
some improvised breakfast in the hostel, I went to Ravensbourne, today it was
the day to start with the sessions. I went to sessions about confidence, others
about Privacy and also, I attended a really interesting talk about
Matrix.org.  The lunch time was also kind
of Networking so I tried to engage in different conversations with people
around me, amazing time.</p>

<p>At night, Mozilla organized a party on the
Royal Society of Arts (RSA) where there was some electronic music by a guy
dressed like Tron, with really futuristic design and music. There was also some
comedy on the Auditory, it was a great night but I headed back sooner than I
expected because I felt really tired of all day sessions.</p>

<p>Third and Last day… We started the day with
a Networking Breakfast in Ravensbourne sponsored by Flattr (You should check
them out, they have great ideas). After it, I decided to go around and try the
different stuff available on it instead of going to more sessions. There, I had
the pleasure to try a great VR game about some experiments that took place in
the military, also, I got to know about The Data Detox Bar and a bunch of other
great stuff there to.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time to go, so I had to say
bye to all the people I met during the festival day and I headed to the train
(Funny story here, due to the time change, the app became crazy and it changed
my whole schedule. I decided to trust my gut and I followed my prescheduled
journey hoping to don’t lose the flight. It worked and after some crazy runs up
and down the London Bridge station, I made it into the train and I headed
towards the Airport. It was time to go back home.</p>]]>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - Resources Reps, what’s next?</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/?p=515</guid>
  <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/11/01/resources-reps-whats-next/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/christosbacharakis/24555180461" title="IMG_8366.CR2"><img alt="IMG_8366.CR2" height="683" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1537/24555180461_93f876d1b2_b.jpg" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>In the previous <a href="https://kelimuttu.github.io/rep-resources-training/">blog post</a>, I wrote about the learnings that we got from the initial training session. And last Friday, we just <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/resources-track-applications-are-now-open/18367/12?u=rizki_kelimutu">announced</a> the new graduates from the final phase of Resources Rep training. The assessment was made during the 3 weeks of the training (whether group or individual exercises) that started on the 2nd of October until 21st of October 2017. You can also see the full list of the Rep Resources graduates in the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">Reps portal</a>. But I would like to quickly take you back on the initial purpose of Resources Reps.</p>
<p><b>What is a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>The idea behind the Resources Reps  is to have specialized Reps who are trained to help communities and other fellow Reps to plan strategically how they use the resources that the Reps program offers. This will ensures that resources of the program are used in the most impactful way and according to the<a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/budget-allocation-q1-2/14650"> guidance</a> provided by Mozilla’s strategy and the Council.</p>
<p><b>When did the training happened?</b></p>
<p>The training sessions happened in 3 phases. The first one, which was the trial training, happened during 24th of July – 12th of August 2017. We asked  6 Reps to participate on this trial session to help us improve the training. After the trial training, we then opened the application for the rest of the Reps and decided to carry on with the first phase of the training with the India applicants during 11th of September – 1st of October. Finally, the last phase happened on the 2nd of October – 21st of October.</p>
<p>During the 3 weeks of the training, the candidates were asked to go through the training material and complete the quiz every  week. And in the end of each week (we decided to have the meeting on the weekend), we scheduled a video meeting for an hour in order to have work and discuss on the subject together.</p>
<p><b>What did we learn from the overall training?</b></p>
<p>On the trial training, the participants helped  a lot in terms of improving the content of the training. Thanks to them, now we have the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Budget/Receipts_guide">receipt guideline</a> to help the Rep identify which receipts are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>On the first phase of the training with Reps from India, we were experimenting with a new video conference tool, which surprisingly performed so much better than the tool that we usually use.</p>
<p>And on the second phase, I learned a lot about accessibility issues. Since we need to accommodate so many time zones, I decided to break the meeting into 2 sessions in each weekend. The first session is for the Asia, Europe, and Africa, and the other session is for the Pacific people who lived in North or South America.</p>
<p>The first meeting was rather challenging since we had people with problems on communication (more specifically a deaf participant and a person that was not able to follow up in English). This came to me as a shock, because that was something I was not prepared for. But fortunately, with some love of the local community, we were able to have an effective meeting. It’s super amazing to see how people were willing to help each other in the training. It was also a reminder for me to think about accessibility in advance for our future activities. For example like providing dial in details for a meeting could be so much beneficial for some people who don’t have access to a PC and can only join via phone. Or checking on the participants before the meeting in case there’s somebody who need special support. Because if we want to excel on diversity and inclusion, then we need to take further action to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p><b>How can I apply to be a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>For now we’re in the process of evaluating our current graduates. So in the meantime, we are not accepting more applications. But there’s a possibility we will reopen the application in the future. We’ll let you know for sure.</p>
<p><b>What’s next?</b></p>
<p>New Reps that  don’t have access to the budget and swag, can now ask for help from these <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Resources">Resources Rep</a>. We will no longer need to assign the bug to the mentor if the request was made by a Resources Rep. And instead it will go directly to the review team. And ideally, the new Reps should choose Resources Rep who’s close to their region. So, for example if I’m a new Rep from the US, I will ask for help from <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/hashrocket/">Jason</a> who in this case is the Resources Rep who live the closest to me. You can also see the group on the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">reps portal</a>.</p>
<p>We’re also going to reshuffle the Review Team members in the near future. The Review Team is now discussing the recommendation list from the current Resources Rep to be sent to the council for the future candidates of the Review team. We’ll keep you updated for the process.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank the participants of the Resources Rep training. And especially for those who always make the time on their weekend to join the meeting in each week. Congratulations!</p>]]>

  <title>Michal Stanke - The story of me@mozilla</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>After our successful presence on the <a href="https://www.linuxdays.cz/2017/">LinuxDays</a> conference in Prague, I have been asked by a <a href="https://www.linuxexpres.cz/">Linux Expres</a> for an interview, how I get to the Mozilla community, what I do there, etc. <del>The article is not public yet</del> The article went out <a href="https://www.linuxexpres.cz/rozhovor/michal-stanke-ceska-komunita-by-mohla-prosazovat-mobilni">today</a>, but I have realized I never told this story to the Mozilla community itself. So take some popcorn and make yourself comfortable…</p>

<p>Back in times when I thought PowerPoint presentations are the masterpiece of computer science and their quality score is determined by the number of animations per slide, my Internet Explorer got sick. After an attempt to change the homepage in hope it will stop showing me ads everywhere, I have decided I need a new browser. I knew some people online and asked them for a recommendation, and their answers were Opera and Firefox. I never saw any of them in action before, so I dived into the dark unknown waters of the internet to download them for testing. My first impression from Opera was it’s too complex and complicated to change the homepage and import bookmarks, while Firefox did that all for me when I clicked all the <em>Next &gt;</em> buttons. The winner was clear.</p>

<p>That was <strong>Firefox 2.0</strong>, way different from Internet Explorer. When exploring the user documentation to help me a bit, I found an information, that 3.0 is imminent. Wow, a browser that is being developed and will have a new <em>version</em>. Super cool for someone using the old IE! But the documentation did not helped me much actually, which drove me right into the registration form of the <strong>Czech community forum</strong>, and here my community story begins.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized that I know answers for other questions on the forum, so I started answering. About the same time I have decided to start using all Mozilla-based applications I can make use of, namely Thunderbird and Instantbird (which I <strong>started localizing</strong> soon). Later the Mozilla.cz team offered me to translate some <strong>articles on SUMO</strong> and websites like AMO, but for me the Czech community forum was still the top until 2014, when Pavel Cvrček (JasnaPaka) offered me to <strong>translate Thunderbird</strong> on my own. That was huge responsibility for me, but also recognition. I thought that’s the most you can achieve, I felt like a real boss.</p>

<p>The next year, 2015, was like a big spinning wheel, outlined by the <strong>Mozilla.cz restart</strong> initiative led by Pavel to rebuild the Mozilla.cz website content (and design) and utilize as much of Mozilla infrastructure as we can. The motto was “Mozilla is doing many things, and they do them right”, it’s not necessary to update own versions of user documentation anymore. The second half of the year was very turbulent. Pavel decided to forward me the responsibility for <strong>Mozilla.cz content</strong> and <strong>Firefox localization</strong>, leaving the community projects due to the lack of time. At the end of the year, the changes in the community probably became so visible, that I have been invited to <strong>Mozlando</strong>, to meet my first non-Czech Mozillians in person.</p>

<p>The last two years I will sum in a sentence or two. I try to act like a community peer for every l10n and support related project in Mozilla, I became a Rep, and after our localization community grew over 4 people, I am unable to name all the milestones we have outlined and achieved. The last two years are not really a story of me@mozilla, but a story of <strong>czech-community@mozilla</strong>.</p>

<p>Now you may think that my involvement with the global Mozilla community is pretty short. And you are right. I am around the global stuff since 2014/15, still having longer experience with support forums answers than anything else. But for me that illustrates how powerful and dynamic the Mozilla community is.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>I was in high school,
sitting in the Computers room, taking part of a boring and monotonous class
about Office IT. Because of that, I decided to open Firefox and start surfing
the web for some entertainment to make the time passed faster. So, I clicked in
the Firefox logo, Firefox popped-up and as soon as it opened, I realized about of
a yellow square at the bottom of Firefox asking me to took part of Mozilla and
become a volunteer. </p>



<p>In that moment, I
was dubitative because I didn’t really know what to do or if it was worth it
but I recalled a conversation I had with my best friend at that time about
Mozilla and its principles and decided to give it a try… I pressed the yellow
squared button and it redirected me into a webpage that showed me all the activities
I could join  (Labs, Localization,
Coding, Marketing, QA…).   After a few minutes, I decided that I wanted
to help with QA, testing some products as Firefox Beta, Firefox Nightly or the now
ceased Firefox Aurora because I wanted to make Firefox a better browser with
less bugs and more stability. </p>



<p>Once I clicked
it, it opened my email prompting me to write an E-Mail to the responsible of QA
Area in Mozilla Hispano (who I would know later as Gabriela) stating that I
wanted to contribute in that area and the reasons for it.  I wrote the email and she quickly answered it giving
me some tasks to do in Teambox (A site we used in order to organize tasks and
activities) as well as giving me some mentorship so I could start helping as
fast as possible. </p>

<p> Time passed really
quick and I went from being a newcomer to be part as a member of Mozilla without
with no more mentorship. Anyway, I kept in touch with Gabriela because she was my
friend and still the responsible of the area. As time passed by, I saw a drop
in the participation of the QA area so I proposed Gabriela a new scheme for it.
She really liked the idea and she decided to offer me the possibility of being
co-responsible of the area so I could help her with all the task involved which
I clearly accepted.  

</p><p> A year passed
without a lot of changes, I routinely participated in the friday testdays about
Firefox Beta, we also organized an amazing Spanish testday which was
well-received and well-appreciated for the Hispanic contributors of Mozilla and
I tried to help in other areas like Marketing or Localization.

</p><p> One day, I saw a
notification about a QA/Localization hackathon that would take part in Paris somewhere
near November 2015. The idea of going to Paris to the Mozilla Office really
fascinated me and I applied as fast as I could, wishing to be selected for it
so I could have the opportunity to meet other people as passionate as I for
Mozilla. Somehow, my wishes became true and I got the chance to travel to Paris
and meet some contributors there like Facyber (My great friend Marko) or
Marcia, a nice woman from Mozilla which I only had the pleasure to talk by iRC
and the one who taught us all she could about FirefoxOS in the short time of
two days. It was a really great experience.

</p><p>Sadly, one day,
Mozilla decided to cut off Firefox OS, and that decision took with it some ups
and downs which made some contributors leave the community because they didn’t
see a clear orientation or a clear focus and all the communities of Mozilla around
the world saw a big break on its activities. In that moment, I was really busy
studying for the exams of the university and other stuff so I became really inactive
for a few months and I did not really see what was coming. </p>



<p>Once I returned,
I realized how everything was stopped and I felt really guilty for it. For that
reason, some contributors and I decided that it was time to relaunch the
community and we got down to work for it. At first, we took some surveys and we
decided some goals for the community but this approach didn’t clearly work out,
so some months later, we decided to take it back and we proposed some interesting
new projects to work on and as of today, it seems it has worked because we got
new projects and new contributors working on them. </p>



<p>To conclude, I
have to add that after relaunching the community, I got really motivated so I
decided that it was time to step up and apply to become a Mozilla Rep as other
people recommended me.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>I started my journey in Mozilla as a contributor to Mozilla Community Rajasthan and met many enthusiasts who inspired me to do  every possible contributions i could do to Mozilla and Open source in general. I am from Jharkhand , after returning from Rajasthan, I met a mozillian from Jharkhand community, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/amitsin6h/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amit Singh</a> , he is very passionate about learning new things and very much like the idea of working in open.</p>
<p>I got to know many problems of the people wanted to contribute. Major problem is the availability of support from Mozilla and Mozilla Reps in general. There are many Reps from this region , but unfortunatly they are working outside this state. They are very helpful in arranging things, but… But they want their presence, they want to hear them in person and want to know their success story, how they came to mozilla and why….. There are many more questions asked by few contributors who wanted to continue the same. I listed their questions and figured out many possible things we could do together to improve the contributions from this region.</p>
<p>I moved to Ranchi officially , it was the time when i was very busy with my work. A phone call rang, it was Amit , wanted to know if i can organize an event in Jharkhand Rai University. I said yes, definitely . He introduced me to Prof. Shudhanshu, after meeting him we fixed the date, 6th Oct. 2017. Made a poster , promoted in Jharkahnd Rai University.</p>
<p><img alt="MozAarambh Poster" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/mozaarambh-poster.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Event day, we reached the venue on time, we received a warm welcome. Prof. Shudhanshu introduced us infornt of students. I see a hall, full pacekd with students almost 200+ . I introduced myself  and why I choose to contribute to Mozilla and Open source. Students were listening this as if they were sitting in a lecture room. It was the tme to bring out few swags , in a minute everyone was answering questions, asking interesting questions. <strong>Swag has some power!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>I started with introduction of Mozilla, Firefox and Open Source. To my surprise everyone knows about these things. Then I got to know that they had one introduction event of mozilla but after that never heard back from that mozillian. Then I introduced them about the mozilla’s products and projects, what actually matters. People were very excited to know about WebVR, Rust and WebCompat .</p>

<p>I forgot to introduce the speakers, I had Amit and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Malam1212/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mahtab</a> with me who was sharing the stage. Amit gave session on WebCompat and even showed a demo on how to file a report. Mahtab gave session on L10n and how a non-coder students still contribute to open source.</p>

<p>Actual thing happend after the event , there were 80 students who wanted to know the possibilities and ways to involve with Mozilla and it’s projects. We get back to the hall ,selected few students who have shown their interest in making a club. I introduced Mozilla Campus Club to them. We formed a team and created Telegram groups so that we stay in loop.</p>

<p>Mozilla Jharkhand has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozilla.jharkhand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">facebook group</a> and after the event people joined this group in hige number, from 170 we reached to 246 in a single day. Not only they joined in this group, they have introduced themself to this group, which i never seen in other community as this scale. This shows they are very active and only need a correct Mentor to guide them.</p>
<p>I will love to do the role of Mentor to them. And next day we were rocking on local newspaper. Planning a series of events in this college to educate them and make a good contributor.</p>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">The event is focused on introducing and teaching the state of art system programming language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust</a> to local programmers and Mozillians in Gujarat.  This is the first time <strong>Mozilla</strong> will participate at <strong>ORDINATEUR’17</strong>! The summit will involve students and tech enthusiasts from the university. I gave a talk on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust programming</a> which is one of emerging technologies and one of the major focus of Mozilla.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>About ORDINATEUR’17 :</strong></p>
<p>ORDINATEUR’17 is a one of a kind flagship event organized by IEEE GCET Computer Society Student Chapter under the them “<strong><em>Tech Trend &amp; Innovate</em></strong>”</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420" height="267" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/poster.jpg?resize=720%2C267" width="720" /></a>Before, I shared my experience with this talk, so let me tell you one thing that this was my one of the best intellectual programming debate talk. Yes, it is! <img alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f600.png" style="height: 1em;" /><span id="more-1416"></span></p>
<p>I have started with Introduction to Mozilla and “Who am I”. Adding to that, I have also shared about Mozilla projects and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust </a>is one of them. So now, Lets Dive Into Rust!</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8975.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1421" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8975.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a><br />
According to me, <em>Rust is a good choice when you’d choose C++. You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why should I use Rust? </strong></em>I am always expecting this question whenever I talk about Rust and here as well one language enthusiast asked me the same questions.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, I have shared the reason that I’ve looked into Rust at first and then I have explained and discussed each point with participants.  </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_04-10-17.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_04-10-17.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages</li>
<li>It is low-level enough that you take account of most resources.</li>
<li>It’s more like C++ and Go, less like Node and Ruby</li>
<li>cargo is awesome. Managing crates just works as intended, which makes a whole lot of troubles you may have in other languages just vanish with a satisfying <em>poof</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8938.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1422" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8938.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a>It was always fun to play with Rust and glad that participants also enjoyed while rusty their hand.</p>

  <title>Mehul Patel - Why Open Source ?</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.rowdymehul.com/?p=1406</guid>
  <link>http://www.rowdymehul.com/mozilla/why-open-source/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Firstly, let me extend the thanks to <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">Yuvalay Electronics Lab</a> for inviting me as Speaker to give a talk on Open Source. Moreover, kudos to you to arrange a talk on Open source first time ever in <span class="_Xbe">Vadodara</span> city.</p>
<p><strong>About Yuvalay Electronics Lab</strong></p>
<p>Yuvalay Electronics Lab offers a platform and eco-system to the students, hobbyists, and professionals to understand and apply the theoretical knowledge of the subjects in the field of Electronics. It helps to convert the interest into the passion by providing a conducive environment to learn-explore-innovate under the guidance of experts. <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">More</a></p>
<p>This is the first time ever I have not presented any presentation, this time it’s gonna be a pure talk where people can ask me anything about open source. I have started my talk with, what I am thinking or believing about open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-31-39.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1408" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-31-39.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a>For me, <em>contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and gain experience. No matter which skills you have, everything can be made useful. In this talk, I have shared the following points which can help you to get started with </em>an<em> open source contribution.</em><span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why contribute to open source?</em></li>
<li><em>What it means to contribute</em></li>
<li><em>Boost yourself to a new project; best example: Github</em></li>
<li><em>How to find a project to contribute to? : some sources Github, Your First PR, and so on.</em></li>
<li><em>How to submit a contribution?</em></li>
<li><em>What happens once you contributed?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I am always asking these questions to my self and trying to find out the answer, and guess what while finding the answer to these questions my contribution to open source automatically done.</p>
<p>A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. For me, contributions don’t have to be tech related as open source projects also need people who have non-tech skills, like documentation, localization, marketing, testing and much more.</p>
<p>For instance, <b><i>What can I do for Mozilla?</i></b> is a resource that helps pair people with the organization’s technical and non-technical needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Why do people contribute to open source? </i></b></p>
<p>To, improve existing skills<br />
To, meet people who are having similar interests<br />
To, find mentors and teach others<br />
To, build public artifacts that help to build your profile</p>
<p>Here are  few of my personal favorites Open Source Platforms;</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux &lt;3</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Python &amp; Rust</li>
<li>VLC Media Player &lt;3</li>
<li>Web Browsers:
<ul>
<li>Firefox &lt;3</li>
<li>Chromium (the basis for Chrome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I bet on you, within these kinds of projects exist more undetected bugs, probable improvements, and documentation deficiency. Therefore, even if you don’t want to learn how to code inside, still you can find ways to take part in the open source world.</i></p>
<p>There was a very healthy discussion between me and all the participants where they asking back to back questions and I am thus thoroughly enjoying to answer those questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-28-47.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-28-47.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a>Our goal via this talk is to make people understand that open source contribution have no explicit literal like hard-earned cash value. But, the implicit value, i.e. the opportunity to contribute to open source widely outweighs any literal cash value you might gain by giving your time over to a project. e.g. Guess how much money I got paid for contributing to Linux package? $0. Yep, it was $0.</p>
<p>Our aim is to people believe that if they don’t file bugs and make steps to reproduce them, or on ways to reproduce expected and unexpected behaviors, so coders/techs have no way of knowing how software gets used and what they should do get resolved.</p>
<p>At last, we also had round discussion of what participants thinking about open source and what their passion about open source.Everyone has shared their views and all an all it was great to hear their views on it.</p>

Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project. This is the way community builds with better engagement.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It has been a long time, I have been writing here. This blog post will be about sharing my personal experience during the Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration at Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, Telangana, India.</p>
<p>I have started contributing to Mozilla way back in 2012 and I am really elated that I have come a long way. All it started when a student from BITS contacted me on Facebook asking about the activities and opportunities that a student can be benefited. I told him about the Mozilla Campus Club Program to him and he got excited about it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, I explained him about Mozilla, its mission, vision, Campus Club Program, activities and how he can be a part of a global community. And then things went fast, we decided to inaugurate a Mozilla Campus Club in their college.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that we will be inaugurating a Mozilla Club on September 1st, 2017.</p>

  <title>Michal Stanke - Mozilla Latest Version - my first project dedicated to Mozilla</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://michal.stanke.cz/2017/09/07/mozilla-latest-version-my-first-project-dedicated-to-mozilla</guid>
  <link>https://michal.stanke.cz/2017/09/07/mozilla-latest-version-my-first-project-dedicated-to-mozilla.html</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaCZ/mozilla-latest-version">Mozilla Latest Version</a> (shortly <em>Mozlv</em>) was my first project I have written entirely because of Mozilla. It’s a WordPress plugin to get the latest version number of Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey and the corresponding links for download or release notes. Currently it loads data from ship-it (<a href="https://product-details.mozilla.org/">product-details.mozilla.org</a>), but it existed even before ship-it started to export this data to public. And at this moment, I am giving <em>Mozlv</em> some love again. ;)</p>

<p>It all started at the beginning of 2015, few months after Pavel Cvrček (JasnaPaka) outlined and kicked off the so called “Mozilla.cz restart”. We have reviewed all the content on the Mozilla.cz website (OK, it was mainly done by Pavel), reduced it and redirected outdated pages to SUMO articles and other appropriate sites, that were update regularly. We have also replaced the old <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/zpravicky/plnime-slib-a-tak-je-tu-novy-web-mozilla-cz/">Mozilla Europe like looking theme</a> for customized One Mozilla design. But despite making the whole website look new and shiny, we were still left with one big problem under the hood. The problem was in new Firefox versions being release every ~6 weeks. Each time a new version of Firefox or Thunderbird had been released, we needed to put it into WordPress. Of course, we had some plugin to update all the download links and version numbers across all pages, but we needed to watch the new releases on our own and paste them into the fields in administration.</p>

<p>Luckily we have realized soon there are several JSON files on mozilla.org and svn.mozilla.org containing exactly the information we needed. March 2015 was the month when <em>Mozlv</em> was born. It took me actually many hours, because PHP was my greatest enemy back then. :D After I have finished the plugin, there were no earth-shaking changes there. Yes, Firefox for Android and iOS were added, yes, ship-it replaced files placed on the svn server, but there were no bigger features, not even needed. Most of my commits were about fixing breakages.</p>

<p>About a week ago, you may have noticed, that I have added few commits and released version 2.0. “Oh, new major version! There must be plenty of new stuff there, right?” No, there is not, but I have been pretty lazy in bumping the versions in the past, deploying individual commits to Mozilla.cz. Making 2.0 sounds appropriate to me when there is a version actually working after so long. And this time <em>Mozlv</em> will hopefully serve another “community restart” - Mozilla.sk. In Czech Republic we see Slovakia like our brothers. I am helping for some time to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639192">revise the content</a> and soon we want to pick a new Mozilla theme too. But there will be one more thing… you are right… updates of Firefox download links. The difference from Mozilla.cz is, that on Mozilla.sk we want to not just switch to <em>Mozlv</em>, but also display an archive of previous Firefox releases. That’s something not implemented in the plugin and I hope to find some time to do it this autumn. And as a bonus, I have discovered there is an AMO JSON API, that would allow us to display information about features extensions from AMO too!</p>

<p><em>Mozlv</em> is my first project and after more than two years, I am surprised the code is still used somewhere, even more it seems to get extended by two quite big features soon and be deployed to a new website. If you run a community website on WordPress and deal with updating Firefox versions manually, try Mozilla Latest Version. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/MozillaCZ/mozilla-latest-version/">GitHub</a> and if you encounter any issues with deployment, feel free to get in touch.</p>]]>

  <title>Mehul Patel - MozConnect with IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.rowdymehul.com/?p=1374</guid>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>While wrapping up with <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/rain-of-rust-how-we-did-it/">RainOfRust</a> campaigns I was working on reports and gathering feedbacks from the community about our recent initiative and we got an overwhelmed responses from the all around. The participation with IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit was one of the feedback of our recent work for the community.</p>
<p>Here IEEE Gujarat Section and IEEE GCET Student Branch invited me to join at IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit which was organized on 3rd &amp; 4th August at G H Patel College of Engineering &amp; Technology, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat.</p>
<p>I was very excited and I accepted their invitation as this was the 1st time Mozilla’s presence at IEEE summit.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_2666.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1381" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_2666.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a><span id="more-1374"></span></p>
<p><strong>About the summit:</strong></p>
<p>The Leadership Summit aims to convene student members of the IEEE to enable them to discuss the growth and development of IEEE student activities in societies, not only within the Section but also in Region 10 (Asia- Pacific) as a whole.</p>
<p>The theme of the summit <strong>was Innovation and Empowerment.</strong></p>
<p>The students will be from all levels of UG and PG programs will be benefitting from the summit. The given theme will encourage and motivate the students on how can they have a way to innovation. There will be discussions and parallel sessions, conducted by Industrialists and professionals, which will focus on the recent trends and upcoming technologies.</p>
<p>This event has definitely uplifted the Section as a whole and created a benchmark for other events taking place across India as well</p>
<p>This was my first visit to this City and university so I was really excited to talk with participants and experts who came to attend this summit.</p>
<p>My session was second last and here I started addressing the audience by sharing about Mozilla and its mission before I moved on to my actual talk i.e. <strong>Open Innovation</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/open.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1376" height="427" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/open.jpg?resize=640%2C427" width="640" /></a>Here we have discussed <em><strong>How open is it for everyone?</strong></em> Many students shared their thoughts during the talk and it was great to hear their thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Open”</strong> means that anyone can publish or invent online without asking for permission, and that the technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then after I have talked about the Open Innovation Toolkit, <em>The Open Innovation Toolkit is a community sourced set of best practices and principles to help you incorporate human-centered design into your product development process. Whether you have a new idea or a working prototype to test, the Open Innovation Toolkit can help.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_4186.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1378" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_4186.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a></p>
<p><em>Mozilla Innovation team have designed best 3 methods,</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Gather Insights</li>
<li>Ideate</li>
<li>Prototype&amp; Test</li>
</ol>
<p>More details, <a href="https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to limited time, I go ahead with <strong>“Ideate</strong>” method to discuss more by running 2 activities among participants.</p>
<p><strong>1st Activity :</strong></p>
<h2><b>5 “Whys”</b></h2>
<blockquote><p>Purpose of this activity to get to the root cause of the problem with the goal of thinking differently and as a result you will analyse the root cause which is great at making sure you are solving the right problem at first.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/photo_2017-08-22_22-26-21.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1380" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/photo_2017-08-22_22-26-21.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2nd Activity :</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Mind map</strong></h2>
<p><em>A Mind Map is a powerful graphic technique which provides a universal key to unlock the potential of the brain.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>This activity helps when you are facing complex problem. They are organic in their structure and allows us to, via a visual representation, explain how a system or concept is complement each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just to understand better we have run this activity with all the participants present there, I have already informed organizing team to put some bank papers and pen to participants kit.</p>
<p>I have explained to them how this works and what they need to follow to be part of this activity: so here are the steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Start in the center of your page with the subject you want to mind map around. For example “Security”</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Break down the main concept into the areas it relates to. Like “Cyber Security”, “tracking”, gadgets”, “tools”, “threats” “precautions” etc.</p>
<p>3. Further, continue branching those streams out and thinking about what is related until your entire paper is filled out.</p>
<p>4. The end result should be having complete overview of the branches of ideas or concepts that came from your starting point.</p>
<p>At the end of this activity, some students shared an overview of the branches of their ideas and that was an amazing experience.</p>

  <title>Abhiram Ravikumar - It’s raining Rust at Red Hat</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://abhiramrk.com/?p=322</guid>

    <![CDATA[<p>I know it’s been a while since I’ve put out a post and mostly because I’m trying to learn amazing things and get my hands dirty, trying to build solutions that actually make sense.</p>
<p>One such pet-project has been Rust, probably the <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/06/08/language-rankings-6-17/">fastest</a> growing systems level programming language today. Hitherto, I’ve always looked at Rust from the outside, never got my hands dirty, mostly because I was under the assumption that it had nothing to do with web development. Turns out, I was completely wrong!</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/rainofrust-campaign-trailer/15852">Rain of Rust</a> campaign gave me an opportunity to revisit the programming language and the reason why it’s been garnering interests at astronomical pace. For a nascent programming language which is in the 1.19th version of its release, it’s challenging the big guns – C and C++. Yes, you heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why">it </a>right.</p>
<h3>On to the campaign</h3>
<p>The campaign, although initiated and led by volunteers from the Mozilla India community at first was later adopted by the larger Mozilla community with contributions from all over the world like these events in <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-activate/">Mexico </a>and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/dive-into-rust-senai-santa-cecilia/">Brazil</a>. The main goal of the event was to increase outreach about the language and train developers to contribute in the rust ecosystem.</p>
<h3>At Bangalore</h3>
<p>As one of the crucial aspects of the campaign was to organize on-the-ground events and so, with the gracious support of our host Sumantro at Red Hat, we managed to pull of a small event consisting of rust enthusiasts and Mozilla Tech Speakers.</p>
<p>We had our very own Vigneshwer leading the introduction to rust and hands-on session. This was well taken by the participants who had just installed rust and exploring what they could do with the language.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have <a href="https://twitter.com/dvigneshwer">@dvigneshwer</a> today kick starting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RainOfRust?src=hash">#RainOfRust</a>  at BLR. <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang">@rustlang</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mozTechSpeakers">@mozTechSpeakers</a> <img alt="🌟" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f31f.png" style="height: 1em;" /> other talks lined up.. <a href="https://t.co/EGvXB63sS3">pic.twitter.com/EGvXB63sS3</a></p>
<p>— Abhiram Ravikumar (@abhi12ravi) <a href="https://twitter.com/abhi12ravi/status/878555743338676225">June 24, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>With witty remarks, use cases and insights of the language, Vigneshwer kept the participants interested. During the hands-on he introduced the <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits">kits </a>built by the Rust India community and explained how participants could use them to learn the language. On the whole, it was a well-rounded session and helped the participants understand why rust is important and how they could contribute.</p>
<p>We then had a talk by Ravi from <a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/">Ather energy</a> which has used rust components to send  location data packets from its two-wheeler vehicles to the cloud in a secure and reliable fashion. His talk was inspirational as the participants were able to visualize how rust could be used in a production scenario.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For the last talk of the day, we had our own ReMo and host Sumantro show a demo on <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, a simple web framework for rust developers. This was in particular interest to me as a web developer, hitherto I was under the impression that rust could only be used for parallel computing and system level programming scenarios.  Now that I know rust has a fast and safe web framework, watch out JavaScript! Here’s Sumantro’s <a href="http://sumantrom.blogspot.in/2017/04/rocket-on-fedora.html">post </a>on how to set it up on Fedora.</p>
<div class="fb-social-plugin fb-post"></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Last word</h3>
<p>On the whole it was personally fulfilling that we pulled off a workshop in ~1 week of planning and what was comforting was that the feedback we received through the new ReMo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/activate.mozilla.community/issues/210">feedback form</a> was a 6+ on a scale of 0-7. Yay!</p>
<p>Finishing off with a mighty group photo. A round of shout-outs to Bhumika and Ra Fey for helping us out with the posters and social media calls to action! You guys are wonderful. ^_^</p>

    <![CDATA[<div class="cooked">
<p>Please join us in congratulating <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/dvigneshwer/" rel="nofollow noopener">Vigneshwer Dhinakaran</a>, our Rep of the Month for July 2017!</p>
<p>Vigneshwer is a data scientist working on realtime data and a tech enthusiast coming from India.</p>
<p><a href="https://scontent.fath3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16179241_1830873240462561_4074884736782256847_o.jpg?oh=3b7236a2a732a381422afc70b1bb1ed1&amp;oe=59F6B539" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <img height="460" src="https://scontent.fath3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16179241_1830873240462561_4074884736782256847_o.jpg?oh=3b7236a2a732a381422afc70b1bb1ed1&amp;oe=59F6B539" width="690" /> </a>During the last months, Vigneshwer (or Viki as most of his friends call him) has been heavily involved on helping building the Rust community in India. His efforts, along with other awesome Reps, have resulted to the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/rain-of-rust-campaign-live/16020">RainofRust Campaign</a>, a campaign with the purpose to spread the Rust language in India and to create early adapters of the language. During the campaign Viki wrote a <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits" rel="nofollow noopener">new event flow</a> while he was leading a lot of the offline and online events. But his work doesn’t stop there. Since the campaign has finished, Viki is leading the efforts to help those early adopters to become Rust contributors in order to strengthen the community in India. Moreover, Viki has participated in the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/07/10/reps-mobilizer-experiment/" rel="nofollow noopener">mobilizers experiment</a> where he was leading the efforts on understanding how to mobilize the Rust community and unlock the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/results-of-the-mobilizer-experiment-for-rust-india/16558">challenges they are facing</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you Vigneshwer for being awesome, keep rocking the open Web! <img alt=":tada:" class="emoji" src="https://cdn-production.discourse.mozilla-community.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=5" title=":tada:" /> <img alt=":tada:" class="emoji" src="https://cdn-production.discourse.mozilla-community.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=5" title=":tada:" /></p>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - Council at the All Hands in San Francisco</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/?p=506</guid>
  <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/07/25/council-at-the-all-hands-in-san-francisco/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco">All Hands Wiki page</a> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about what we’ve accomplished in Q2 and the future of the program. One of our main topics was on how to get new developers involved as contributors in Mozilla projects.</p>
<h3>Top topics</h3>
<p>For that reason it was crucial to understand and discuss the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/07/10/reps-mobilizer-experiment/">mobilizers experiment</a> and their outcomes with Srushtika, Daniele and Vigneshwer, in order to understand what are the issues and needs for Add-ons, Rust and WebVR and how we can create communities around those projects and attract new developers.</p>
<p>The idea “Open by Design” was discussed extensively while we’ve tried to understand how Reps program can contribute to the Strategy project. We also had a meeting with Patrick Finch to discuss a few strategy questions and to start the discussion on how the Reps program can help in the next few months.</p>
<p><img src="https://discourse-paas-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b11e8507a66ac4e684279e744cddd7d2b20a34e8.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Other meetings and sessions</h3>
<p>We had other sessions as well. Also we did a lot of administrative tasks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participated in the Q&amp;A Session with Chris Beard</li>
<li>Gave feedback on the <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2017/03/13/the-worldview-of-mozilla/">World View project</a></li>
<li>We reviewed our <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/04/20/reps-program-objectives-q2-2017/">Q2 OKRs</a> and opened <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues">issues</a> where necessary to continue in Q3</li>
<li>Updated the Wiki header of Reps pages with a link to the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Leadership">Leadership page</a></li>
<li>Moved the Council Chair from Konstantina to Flore</li>
<li>Started to document new criteria for Reps applications</li>
<li>Further documented the mobilizers initiative and discussed common topics that were raised around those</li>
<li>Had a meeting with Module Owner and Peers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://discourse-paas-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/0947e32116b9f301f74f59a3a6dd6662727639a6.jpg" /></p>
<h3>MozActivate</h3>
<p><a href="http://activate.mozilla.community/">Activate</a> holds a special place at Reps activities. During the All Hands we held meetings about the website, the content of the activities and the future of the project. From the Council side Alex Lakatos with Michael Kohler are involved in the website building, while Konstantina Papadea and Ankit Gadgil are working with a focus on the content.</p>
<p>While in San Francisco we <a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/nightly/">launched a new activity about Nightly</a> which now is available on the website. Firefox Nightly is one of the most important projects happening right now in the Mozilla world and it’s crucial for us. We need to get new Firefox Nightly users.</p>
<p>We also joined discussions with the Rust and the Add-ons teams in order to better understand how the Reps Program can help to build their community or improve the promotion of those technologies.</p>
<p>On the feedback form front we are working on the dashboard to simplify the access to feedback of Activate events.</p>]]>

  <title>Mehul Patel - Rain Of Rust – How we did it?</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RainOfRust_Color.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" height="215" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RainOfRust_Color.png?resize=720%2C215" width="720" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up I was a tech geek, always kept myself updated with the latest ongoing in the language world. It always excited me to explore the tiny bits of these platforms and constantly kept myself updated with brushing my knowledge.</p>
<p>About 9 months ago I met <strong>Manish Goregaokar</strong>, who works in Mozilla as a Rust/Servo Contributor met me at Mozilla India meetup which was organized by Mozilla India team and I was one of the core team member organizing that event. He introduced me this programming language and gradually I became very fond of it, finding it very interesting and exciting to explore this language.</p>
<p>Eventually after spending some time, analyzing and exploring this programme, I discovered that masses including students, startups, developers are not completely aware, very few users actually being aware about Rust. Even after spending a quality time on this programming language, I still feel I have a whole new world to be discovered up in front of me. Simultaneously I thought it would be wise to educate users regarding Rust language. I seeked help from my mentors,friends and staff from Mozilla in setting up a campaign to spread awareness about Rust. This is how we came up with Rain Of Rust campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>About Rain Of Rust :</strong></p>
<p>Rain of Rust Campaign, a month-long global campaign in which would be specifically focused on the Rust language. It has taken place in June 2017 in collaboration with the Rust community.</p>
<p><strong>Key stats of RainOfRust campaign June 2017:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>19 offline events across 10 regions globally. Ref</li>
<li>4 online meeting which is recorded in Air Mozilla. Ref</li>
<li>As part of the campaign the RainOfRust has Rust teaching kits which currently has 3 application-oriented activities</li>
<li>The Github repo has received more than 500+ views in the within 1 month, <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/rain-of-rust-campaign-live/16020">Read more</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1343"></span></p>
<p>I contributed in Rust community by travelling across 8 cities in India through spreading awareness, educating and promoting Rust  amongst students, developers, entrepreneurs &amp; young aspirants.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>During the second quarter of 2017, and in order to understand how to better identify, recruit and support <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/02/13/reps-as-mobilizers-in-the-mozilla-community/">mobilizers</a>, we decided to run a small experiment with a reduced set of existing “best in class” mobilizers and walk with them during their work supporting technical communities.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Reps program is a program for core mobilizers, who create, grow, sustain and engage communities around Mozilla projects. There are still improvement areas in order to become  a state of the art mobilizer program, so we wanted to identify which are these areas and which are the changes we can implement.</p>

<h2>Process Overview</h2>
<p>We decided to use a human centered design approach to test this hypothesis. Each project started with a research phase followed by multiple iterations of potential solutions. Each iteration involved testing, reflecting on the learnings and iterating on the approach.</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2017/07/Mobilizer-experiment-Workflow.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-504" height="450" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2017/07/Mobilizer-experiment-Workflow-600x450.png" width="600" /></a>Overall main learnings</h3>
<ol>
<li>A certain degree of understanding of the technology is needed for the mobilizer to be truly effective and understand the communities.</li>
<li>It’s key to devote enough time to do research and understand the local environment and the potential contributors needs
<ol>
<li>After a solid research, we can start thinking on which are and implement the best channels for communications between the community (sync and async) as well as information distribution (announces, materials…)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are two important areas when working with technical communities:
<ol>
<li>Getting people excited about the tech and the community</li>
<li>Keeping people engaged after the main activities take place. The top priority should be designing for the follow-up instead of the activity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Establishing a direct conversation between mobilizers and the functional area staff is key for having a correct direction and impactful outputs.
<ol>
<li>Teams that work with more closed tools (slack) presented a bigger challenge</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of these learnings we will evaluate a set of recommendations to improve the Reps program and we will share with some early ideas soon on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/reps">Reps discourse</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you Vigneshwer, Daniele, Srushtika and Bob</strong>, your work is an inspiration to all Reps and to the rest of Mozilla, you have demostrated strong leadership and an impact-oriented strategy thinking that will help others to follow your steps.</p>]]>

  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - Let’s increase Firefox Market share</title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="cooked">
<p>With the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Gal" rel="nofollow noopener">Andreas Gal’s</a> latest <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> it is quite clear that we are losing our market share and same can be seen on Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" rel="nofollow noopener">Usage Share Page</a>.</p>
<p>I am a Mozilla Rep. When I joined Mozilla 4 years back, I was literally knowing only three browsers <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>(thanks to Microsoft), <strong>Google Chrome</strong>(here due to Android) and <strong>Opera Mini</strong>(Only browser which uses less data then).<br />
But thanks to the community in Rajasthan which was so much active then, promoting Mozilla and it’s Mission. That was the first time when I get to know about Mozilla Firefox. Firefox is a product which is the core of Mozilla, this is what I believe and assume other volunteers,mozillians and Reps Share the same.</p>
<p>Today, Firefox is mainly used by Mozilla volunteers and few engineers that to are losing faith in it due to compatibility issue and other problems.To name a few, Hangout call is not supported by Firefox, which we use more often for our monthly meeting in India. So what we could do is, create a campaign just like Firefox Nightly and Rain of Rust to promote the use of Firefox, where we will introduce this browser to the students which are still unaware of the browser, which you may agree too.</p>
<p>We are a country with a population of over 1.311 billion where <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/At-315-million-India-has-the-most-students-in-world/articleshow/37669667.cms" rel="nofollow noopener">315 million</a> are students, if we could target those and industry people. This will definitely increase our market share.</p>
<p>I agree that Firefox sometimes doesn’t behave well and we lack other support too which is available in other browsers. I also see a great opportunity for us to make this browser more advanced and easy to use.We want a browser which we love. During this campaign, we will be collecting lots of feedback and suggestions and how you want this browser for yourself. Then we will share these reports with Mozilla staff and help them to create a browser which people love.</p>
<p>I would love to know your feedback and suggestion regarding this campaign as well as any correction will be appreciatable.</p>
<p>Please follow this <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/lets-increase-firefox-market-share/16793" rel="noopener" target="_blank">topic</a> on discourse for more updates</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
