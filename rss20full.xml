  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><em>This post was written by <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh Chavan</a></em></p>
<p><b>TL;DR</b></p>
<p><i>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The</i><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco"><i> All Hands Wiki page</i></a><i> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about improve 2018 planning. </i></p>
<p>The Mozilla All-Hands was organized between 11th June to 15th June 2018 in San Francisco. All Hands are a unique and special opportunity for all paid staff and our most impactful volunteers to come together, in person, to share experiences and interact with people they may not normally work with.</p>
<p>This year’s All Hands was a great learning experience for the Reps Council and Peers.</p>
<p>The Reps Council worked more on the projects which could directly or indirectly help the community and align the plan for the community for the next quarters.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we made was a little recap of what we have done in the first half:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/reps_council.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-553" height="241" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/reps_council-252x241.jpg" width="252" /></a></p>
<p>The Reps Council members were invited to join the different meetings which were focused on Localization of Firefox, the Addon sprint campaigns to define the final plan and Diversity &amp; Inclusion.</p>
<p>The status of Mission Driven Mozillians and the Mozilla Group experiment in India was also shared with the Reps Council. The Reps Council was very interested to understand how the program can fit in and align itself with the new opportunities.</p>
<p>The Reps Council also ran a check on the issues opened in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues">https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues</a> and assigned tasks on the issues which were pending or open since a while.</p>
<p>The Reps Council and Peers discussed some of the important things which are as follows :</p>
<p>– Achievements in the past quarter</p>
<p>– Mozilla Reps Logo</p>
<p>– Mozilla Reps Newsletter team</p>
<p>– Prioritize tickets for the Reps Portal</p>
<p>– Collecting ideas about data gathering to enable data-driven decisions</p>
<p>– Issues on priorities</p>
<p>– Failure and Success of the Reps program</p>
<p>– Mission Driven Mozillians</p>
<p>– H2 plan</p>
<p>There was a meeting on the H2 plan to discuss and assign priorities. A blogpost about this plan would be shared soon.</p>
<p>The Open Innovation Team shared the numbers of the Sprints of this half of the year where there was an huge involvement of our Reps and communities.</p>
<p>The All Hands was quite productive for the Reps Council and the things which were discussed would start be getting reflected in the present quarter (July, August, September).</p>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - In loving memory of Abbackar DIOMANDE</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/?p=549</guid>
  <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2018/07/18/in-loving-memory-of-abbackar-diomande/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It brings us great sadness to share with you the recent news about one of our dear Rep we will so fondly remember. Abbackar DIOMANDE from Ivory Coast is unfortunately no longer with us.</p>
<p>Diomande, was a Mozillian from Bouake, Ivory Coast and was contributing in various Mozilla projects including SUMO and L10n.<br />
He was a local community builder, that helped to build a healthy local community in his country while lately he had also taken the role of a Resources Rep, helping his fellow Mozillians on organizing local initiatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/diomande.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-550" height="448" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/diomande-252x448.jpg" width="252" /></a><br />
His passing is finding us sadden and shocked. His contributions helped our community intensively and while we have a heavy heart, we know that his passion and inspiration will sustain with us.</p>
<p>Our condolences to his family and friends.</p>
<p><b>Bellow are some words about Diomande and his work from his community members in French</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Puisse Dieu t’accueillir dans son royaume Diomande. Mes Condoléances à toute la famille.</p>
<p>Diomandé a été un de mes meilleurs mentorés, il a aimé et est toujours resté fan de Mozilla , avec le coeur il a su toujours selon sa façon conduire sa passion pour Mozilla.<br />
Tu n’a pas souffert, que la terre te soit légère et tu puisse trouver la paix. Repose en paix Diomandé.<br />
Mes condoléances à toute ta famille, tes amis qui t’aimaient et toute la famille Mozilla.</p>
<p>Rip Cher ami , le passage est obligatoire , Puisse Dieu te reserver un acceuille céleste digne de tes apports volontaires , Mozillians from Pigier</p>
<p>Courage, oui grand courage à la famille, un genie ne meurt jamais. Abbackar n’est pas mort, il nous attend juste de l’autre côté de la rive. Abbackar n’est pas mort, Abbackar vivra toujours.</p>
<p>Diomandé été un des contributeur de Mozilla, à travers tous ses ateliers ou actions menées pour la communauté, ses traces resterons à jamais, elles continueront de parler de lui. Je retiens à lui, un grand homme plein de valeurs, son époque sera marqué par des traces indélibiles. ( Wilfried N’Guessan )</p>
<p>Diomandé était un bosseur, un battant qui a aimé trop le développement d’applications. Il a proposé des solutions innovantes . Mes respects pour chaque bonne action qu’il a fait pour ce monde. (Ange Bagui)</p>
<p>Un MozBoy est pati. Un arbuste qui avait toutes les aptitudes pour devenir une grande arbre avec de grande branches et un gros spectre d’ombre. La communauté a perdu un véritable passionné. YAKO A TOUS !!!</p>
<p>Cher ami, c’est avec les larmes aux yeux et une grande tristesse que je redige cette note. Tu vas nous manquer!</p></blockquote>]]>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - H2 2018 Reps Plan for the Council</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/?p=544</guid>
  <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2018/07/16/544/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><em>This blogpost was authored by </em><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mte90/"><em>Daniele Scasciafratte</em></a></p>
<h2>What we have done</h2>
<p>In the first half of the year, our focus was to align the program with <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/tags/mission-mozillians">Mission Driven Mozillians</a> and prepare the mandatory Reps onboarding course to ensure it aligns with the D&amp;I work. We have also started improving the understanding of issues of different Reps roles like Mentors and Alumni.</p>
<p>We also worked on administration issues like the transition of inactive Reps to Alumni, the cleanup of old Reps applications still open after years and wrong mentors assigned to profiles and the improvement of our reporting system. Last but not least, we moved to the creation of expertise teams that took over everyday work day tasks from the Council (newsletter and onboarding).</p>
<p>We’ve chosen to split our ideas and tasks in 3 different areas for the next half of the year (with percentage):</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians: 45%</li>
<li>Visible wins: 45%</li>
<li>Miscellaneous: 10%</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians</h2>
<p>The Reps program is working to prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians and there are different tasks and issues to face for that.</p>
<p>The most important point for the Reps Council is the Roles of Reps inside the communities. We know that in Mozilla there are a lot of international communities, local community and project specific communities, and we need to understand and be ready to support all of them.</p>
<p>We gathered different ideas that we will investigate soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Role of Reps
<ul>
<li>Update all the Reps about the last updates of the Mission Driven Mozillians program
<ul>
<li>Understanding and agreement on Leadership Agreement</li>
<li>Start conversations on where Reps belong/Reps Role</li>
<li>We are already working on:
<ul>
<li>Restart Newsletter with a new team</li>
<li>Discussion about migrating the Reps mailing list to Discourse</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create courses for various roles
<ul>
<li>Review Team and Mentors already have a course</li>
<li>We are working on a new onboarding course</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skills criteria for various roles
<ul>
<li>Every role has a skillset and we are working to improve them as requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mozilla Groups (MDM)
<ul>
<li>How they fit inside the Reps program
<ul>
<li>This is an experiment and we need to understand how the program can fit to be part of this initiative</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Onboarding
<ul>
<li>New SOPs for various roles/teams
<ul>
<li>We updated SOPs in the past and we need to define where we need to update them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courses inside the program
<ul>
<li>Few roles have courses but for Reps we need to define if we can do general courses or if we can find them already available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPG Alignment (update the Reps with updated CPG information, add it as mandatory part to the onboarding course)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Visible wins</h2>
<p>The program also needs to be more visible inside Mozilla and the others communities, so we’ve chosen to focus on 3 different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication
<ul>
<li>Discover new areas where Reps are missing
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of communities where we don’t have a large representation or there is no interest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reps news to all Mozilla
<ul>
<li>Share what Reps are doing, for example during the Weekly Monday Project Call</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statistics
<ul>
<li>Showcase events inside Mozilla
<ul>
<li>Improve the sharing of statistics about what volunteers are doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Campaigns
<ul>
<li>Plan for more than 3 weeks out
<ul>
<li>Let the community be aware of a new campaign in advice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pocket involvement
<ul>
<li>Part of Mozilla but there is no involvement of volunteers right now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an event asset repository
<ul>
<li>Events often require the same resources such as graphics or links, we need to gather them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The last area that we chose are the miscellaneous ideas, something that does not block the program’s goals but can improve it, at the same time this has low priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving mentee/mentors relationship</li>
<li>Improving understanding of Alumni role</li>
<li>Improve reps-tweet social usage</li>
<li>Style guidelines for the community</li>
<li>Reporting activities
<ul>
<li>Encourage Reps to report activities
<ul>
<li>Without reports it’s difficult to do data-driven decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand issues Reps face with reporting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of ideas will be evaluated in the next quarters by the Council and as usual we are open to feedback!</p>]]>

  <title>Md Shahbaz Alam - LinuxCon China</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>LinuxCon China was a technical conference for developers, operations experts (architects, sys admins, devops), business, compliance and legal leadership and other professionals to come together in an informal setting to learn from open source experts, have fascinating discussions, collaborate with peers, and gain a competitive advantage with innovative open solutions.</p>
<p>This year I got an opportunity to talk about and represent Auth0 and Mozilla at LinuxCon. It was a 3-day conference where My first talk was based on Serverless where I was representing Auth0 and next day I was representing Mozilla with A-frame and WebVR theme.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180626_092158" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1086" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_20180626_092158-e1530764692916.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>The first day was really amazing as I had to visit all the sponsor’s booth where I got swags and most importantly networking. My talk on Serverless was at 16:20 Chinese Time. It was wonderful to see many attendees waiting for the talk, I started the <a href="https://slides.com/mdsbzalam/lc3-china/">presentation</a> where I discussed the basics of Client-Server architecture and why we need security layer and how one can get started with serverless. The response of the talk was really good as many came after the session for the get started link and to clear their doubts. It was a good day at the conference.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/linuxcon-china/img_20180626_142830/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_20180626_142830.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150" width="113" /></a>

<p>The second day, I had an open session at the CNCC, where I was given a space where attendees came to interact and know about the project. The project I was having was of A-frame and WebVR. It was really fun to interact with the Chinese attendees as many were unable to understand or speak English, so I had to use VPN to use Google Translate( good translation <img alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ). Many were excited to know about A-frame since it requires a very little amount of background in computer science to get started. I have shared the links with them via email and wechat. It was a good day to conclude the conference and very happy to represent both Mozilla and Auth0.</p>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Taking WebXR to the most energetic gen</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/?p=159</guid>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><strong>Venue: Academic heights public school, Hyderabad</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 20.05.2018</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I in the first place wondered whether a topic like WebXR going to complicate the audience I targeted for the day. My audience included 50+ kids, their parents and their guardians of the AHP school. But when I showed the crowd the VR googles and asked the question what is it and what does that deal with, I got answers from 5 kids. With no doubt the kids were familiar with Virtual Reality as they had played games in malls and game arcades in their city. Also they were familiar with Augmented Reality as they had played Pokemon Go in their mobile phones. This eventually made my job easy.</p>

<a href="https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/taking-webxr-to-the-most-energetic-gen/2-2/#main"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/2.jpg?w=115&amp;h=150" width="115" /></a>
<a href="https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/taking-webxr-to-the-most-energetic-gen/img_2164/#main"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2164.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I amused them with the fusing results of AR and VR and how this can lead to WebXR. They loved experimenting with the VR googles. They in fact gave solutions on how their education system can be improvised with technologies like these. It was very much vibrant to see these kids who wanted to make their classrooms more interesting.</p>

<a href="https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/taking-webxr-to-the-most-energetic-gen/img_2145/#main"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2145.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://kbmtechie.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/taking-webxr-to-the-most-energetic-gen/img_2189/#main"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2189.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon session was mainly focussed for parents and guardians. I emphasised on why this gen must be involved in learning latest technology. Also in most parts of India after a girl child finishes her studies, about 70-80% percent are married at an earlier age (that is before they getting an industry ot real technology exposure), so application of knowledge is very less. To overcome this I shared ideas and motivated the parents to allow their girls to freely explore what they need in life in terms of technology or any other innovation. Furthermore, I took myself as an example and told them my journey and how I got into Mozilla and also how Mozilla helps its women contributors through its Womoz program.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2205" class=" size-medium wp-image-166 aligncenter" height="225" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2205.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final touch as usual, no matter whatever the age group my audience fall into, they always love the swags from Mozilla.</p>
<p><img alt="1" class=" size-medium wp-image-167 aligncenter" height="226" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=226" width="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a closing note, I thank AHP school, Hyderabad for inviting me as a speaker for their Summer School progam 2018. Also my humblest gratitude to Mozilla and Shahbaz (my Reps mentor) for always encouraging me to participate in these wonderful events.</p>]]>

  <title>Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran - Organise things right!</title>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Global Sprint which was going throughout the world on various projects made Fahima and me to think about the event in our home town too. So I took the initiative to organise all things required for this event. I thought this way I would also learn a lot on event organisation and hosting.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2018-05-11_13-34-54" class="  wp-image-146 aligncenter" height="216" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/photo_2018-05-11_13-34-54.jpg?w=288&amp;h=216" width="288" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had 15+ participants who actively took part in this event. The event was focussed on SOHW(Spread Open Healthy Web) project and explained in what ways the participants can do their part in this project.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2107.JPG" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148" height="219" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2107.jpg?w=292" width="292" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this project we had various issues and its main objective was to be a single point of access to the resources thus helping the newbies to start their contributions. The issue had various interesting topics like making memes, designing logo and also many stuffs related to building the webpage for this particular project. Eventually, there were many options to contribute.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2099.JPG" class="aligncenter  wp-image-149" height="249" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_2099.jpg?w=332&amp;h=249" width="332" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the afternoon, we attended the global online conference call where everyone got an opportunity to speak about their projects. It was indeed amazing to see other projects happening world-wide. Found that this sprint was indeed spread across miles and had a great impact in relevant to current technologies and open source.</p>
<p><img alt="photo_2018-05-11_22-33-04.jpg" class="  wp-image-150 alignleft" height="184" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/photo_2018-05-11_22-33-04.jpg?w=245&amp;h=184" width="245" />    <img alt="photo_2018-05-11_22-32-56" class="  wp-image-152 alignright" height="190" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/photo_2018-05-11_22-32-56.jpg?w=253&amp;h=190" width="253" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="Dc7Z2ebV4AI-J-n.jpg" class="  wp-image-153 alignright" height="85" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/dc7z2ebv4ai-j-n.jpg?w=151&amp;h=85" width="151" />Finally, we concluded the event with some feedback from the participants and also distributed the swags. We are very much grateful Smt. Sujatha, Principal, Sai Bhuvaneswari Vidyalaya N&amp;P school, for sponsoring a beautiful venue. The event was a great success and also we had contributors to this project from overseas where they worked in remote.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>This is my second visit to Pune, after my recent <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//GNUNify_18">GNUify</a> event. GNUNify was mainly focused for Student developers, the target audience were getting started with Open source community. COeP Foss Meetup had well experienced developers and students who are contributing for FOSS community more than 1 year. Abhijit who is the professor at COEP and helping lot of students to get started with community. He is an amazing person I meet, who came forward to share his thoughts about my presentation and spends time with students and motivates them a lot.</p>
<p><img alt="COEP Talk on Stage" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/coep_talk.JPG" /></p>
<p>The hall was really big filled with 200 attendees. Energy was really good and I was really excited to give the presentation. For this presentation I have been showing the demo with Commands API and tabs.ExecuteScript API. The internet was really slow during my presentation, due to this therewas some breakage in the flow. Abhijit Sir, came forward to share his Mobile internet and I was able to show the demo of my Youtube Extension.</p>
<p>Some of the questions came around the Chrome Compatibility, and one of the long time Mozillian Friend Ankit gave suggestions in improving the Extensions which is used for demo.</p>
<p><img alt="COEP Ankit Question" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/coep_ankit.JPG" /></p>
<p>After my session we had amazing session by Kushal Das on SecureDrop. Then we had a session by Rahulkrishnan on Docker.</p>
<p>After the session we had a small Tea break session, where contributors from various projects came and had informal discussion. Some of the contributors who tried to become Mozilla Reps or tried to contribute to various projects shared the pros and cons in community.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to Ankit home and meet his family, had a very good tea time with them. After that we went to the near by mall and tried some amazing local food.</p>
<p>I personally felt this is amazing Meetup I have been. I really felt bad I didnt plan to attend the second day of the event. In upcoming years I will make sure to give talk on this Meetup. Personal thanks to Vikrant (student from coep), who was with me for the whole day.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>Lovely Professional University is a private university situated in Jalandhar, Punjab, India. It is a well know educational institutions in the country with around 34000 students and over 130 programs. Mrinal and I were invited to LPU for a workshop on WebVR ( Virtual Reality ). We reached LPU on 17th April and visited the campus.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1075" style="width: 798px;"><img alt="DSC_0002" class="alignright size-large wp-image-1075" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0002.jpg?w=788&amp;h=526" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The morning started with a good cup of tea</p></div>
<p>We reached the auditorium on time. And yes it was filled with 1300 students. One of the biggest auditorium I have seen till now.</p>
<p><img alt="DSC_0013" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1062" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0013.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>The event started with a brief introduction of speakers and then I started the explaining the difference between Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. Also Why we need these technologies?</p>
<p><img alt="_DSC3335" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1073" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc3335-1.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Started with the Aframe Presentation slide to explain the basics of WebVR and A-frame. Students were really interested to know more about it.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/_dsc3346-2/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="100" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc3346-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/dsc_0010/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="100" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0010.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/dsc_0011/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="100" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dsc_0011.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100" width="150" /></a>

<p>After a while, students were getting bored, so I started with Virtual Girlfriend story ( Prathamesh’s story it is ) to explain the difference of VR, AR, and MR. And what all application we can build and solve real problems.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>The event was really good, students asked many questions related to Mozilla, it’s product and Open Source in general. Would love to visit again <img alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Again trio has come together for a wonderful event. This time it was IIT-BHU. The event started with the introduction of the speakers, Shahbaz, Umesh and Prathamesh ( trio aka SUP ). Prathamesh started the session explaining the difference between VR, AR, and MR. People were amazed to know that they will be creating their VR experience after the brief presentation.</p>
<p>After Prathamesh, I talked about basics of WebVR and how easy it is to build in just a few lines of codes.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from 2018-04-09 23-30-28.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1046" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/screenshot-from-2018-04-09-23-30-28.png?w=788" /></p>
<p>The hacking began with remixing Hello World example on glitch.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’ll be using more pics to describe what happened in the event.</p>

<p><strong>Date: 24<sup>th</sup> March,2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue: SRM University, Chennai</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day started with the inauguration by the chief guest, Mr. Raaman. It was an interesting talk on Linux forum and how open source plays the real trend in today’s world. I was very glad and proud to be amidst of great speakers who were very much senior to me in age and also in experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="photo_2018-04-01_18-09-47" class="  wp-image-141 aligncenter" height="329" src="https://kbmtechie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/photo_2018-04-01_18-09-47.jpg?w=329&amp;h=329" width="329" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My session happened in the second half slot and I initially gave a small pitching about my talk and audience who were interested to know more took part in my session. Surprisingly, I had 50+ enthusiastic audiences who were very keen to know the tricks and magic hidden in WebXR. I shared my in detail on how WebXR works followed by definitions on WebVR, WebAR and WebMR. Furthermore, I amused my participants with my demos and gave them an idea on how this technology can be used in real time for useful applications. Moreover, I shared about the WebVR Challenge and how to approach the same.</p>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>HackFest is IIT(ISM) Dhanbad’s 36-hour annual hackathon organized by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) and ACM Student Chapter, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.</p>
<p>The event started with an introduction of speakers. <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh</a>, <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/umesh/">Umesh</a>, and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahbaz/">Shahbaz</a> ( yep it’s me ), since we had limited time with us. So it was a quick talk-demo-workshop.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232299546" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232299546.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Prathamesh started with his favorite virtual girlfriend story to explain the concept of  Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. After a long and tiring hackathon, the audience seems interested and was into it.</p>
<p><img alt="FB_IMG_1522232272809" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1015" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fb_img_1522232272809.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>I talked about the basics of WebVR, why we brought the VR on Web and what are their advantages. Used Kevin’s presentation for explaining the concept in details with his amazing presentation (<a href="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/" rel="nofollow">https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining what WebVR is, we asked participants to visit <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="nofollow">https://aframe.io/</a> and remix the hello world example on  <a href="http://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://glitch.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>Due to the limited amount of time, participants couldn’t finish their idea. So we gave them a contest, where top 5 scenes will get a surprise gift from us.</p>
<p>And here comes, what we love most. After event photograph with the participants.</p>

<p>We will be seen together soon in IIT-BHU.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>WebMR is a new technology which is in its initial stages. WebMR was the thing which has brought a huge participation at Baroda.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly waiting for us. Event started with a brief introduction of the speakers. Prathamesh Chavan and I talked about our love to open source.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_103016_bokeh/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_103016_bokeh.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p>Prathamesh talked about the differences of WebVR WebAR and WebMR. His way of relating things to virtual girlfriend has brought a new spark in attendees.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_134118" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1003" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_134118.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I talked about basics of Virtual reality and why we have brought the VR on Web. And how easy it is to code and experience the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_145209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1001" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_145209.jpg?w=788" /><br />

Lunch time, we went to Nosh Farmaiye, best place in town for chicken kebabs. Must place to visit when you’re in town.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180224_123451" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1004" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_123451.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>After the lunch we started the hand-on session of WebVR . And to do so nothing is better than a hello world example. We have used glitch to live demo the scenes.</p>
<p>First day concluded with the prize distribution to the top 5 teams.</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20180225_085802" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180225_085802.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Second day started with WebAR, I explained the differences and similarities in AR and VR. Here again started with hello world example using hero marker.<br />
And talked about new features of AR and VR.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_160339/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_160339.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_142250/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="84" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_20180224_142250.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84" width="150" /></a>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Date: 17.03.2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue : PES University, Bangalore, India.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was my first presentation on WebXR as my previous talks were mostly focused on WebVR and projects related to it. There were around 150+ enthusiastic participants who actively participated in this event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The morning first half session, I briefed about Mozilla and its projects. As the students haven’t come across Mozilla rather than its Firefox browser, I got this platform to rightly propagate about the community and how they can involve themselves in volunteer contributions both as individual and as an institution.  I mainly emphasized on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add-ons/ Webextensions</li>
<li>Localisation</li>
<li>SuMo</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>WebVR</li>
<li>Mozilla Mixed reality</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forenoon second half session involved a deep dive into WebXR. I found the audience struck with surprise on how technology has rapidly grown and how Mozilla is also into the competition.  After giving a detailed notion on WebXR I showed a few demos on my contributions to WebVR and WebAR.</p>

<p></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the intervals the students got a chance to experience Virtual Reality world using VR googles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a feedback form to be filled by my audience and based on this I was about to predict the count of participants for my afternoon session. To my surprise almost 80% of the attendees came forward for the hands-on session.</p>

<p></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I initially helped with two different Hello World programs using A-frame. Later I hosted a mini hackathon that is, to create a WebVR or WebAR application on either “<strong>Informative Pokemon world</strong>” or “<strong>Press for Progress-International Women’s day 2018</strong>”.  Almost everyone gave a very unique try and within 30 minutes they were competing enthusiastically. Finally, I got the tiresome task of choosing the winner of the contest and I appreciated them with A-frame T-shirts. The students were indeed glad to take away the swags and were contented for the time they had invested.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My sincere thanks to the Computer Science department of PES University, Bangalore for helping me to get the happiness, because true satisfaction comes only in sharing. Also the coordinators and volunteers did a perfect job to make this show a grand success.</p>]]>

  <title>Viswaprasath KS - KGiSL Mozactivate 2018</title>

    <![CDATA[<p>KGiSL community space is very close to every Mozillian around Tamilnadu, we had our first meetup there. There are lot of events related to Mozilla and open source communities happen at this space. After so long time I got opportunity to come to this space and share my knowledge about the WebExtension.</p>
<p>For this event, I personally started training 6 students before the event. My main goal is to make sure they are in good position to explore more about WebExtensions and answer the questions which are asked by their friends during session. It is like Train the trainers. We in Mozilla India community are doing great job by developing many WebExtensions but at the same time the number of trainers are less and it started increasing slowly in past few days.</p>
<p>On the event day around 35 students appeared, the attendence was very less due to the Job Fair  happening in the city all of the sudden. Till Friday evening there were good amount of registration but sudden announcement of Job fair made Final year and Third year students to go there. They are the main audience of the session. But some of them turned up.</p>
<p>During this session I was discussing about ContextMenu, as the students will be more interested to hack them compared to any other API. The students present were able to grasp the knowledge very quickly. One of the interesting thing happned to me for the first time is, I have to work without computer; yes on that day I was using the Black board to teach students and this is the first time I am doing it. Explaining using Black board was very interesting and I was very happy to do it.</p>
<p><img alt="WebExtension workshop at KGiSL" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/Kgisl_hack.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was excited to know two of the attendees developed their extension and pushed them to AMO.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ShankarDhandapani/WebExtensions">Translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-selection/">Search</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mozillatn.github.io/KiTE/blog/KGISL-ADDON-Hack">Blog post by KGiSL club</a></p>
<p>Most intersting and must needed part is, Sriram created Video about his extension, how he developed and explained his code, how to run it in browser. This is one of the great job done. I used to suggest many students about this, and Many techspeakers are now focusing on creating video tutorials, thanks to Sriram as he started at this early time.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>In future I will be collobrating with this students and planning to continue creating more vidoes about WebExtensions.  This will be really helpful and we can bring more students as TechSpeakers in future.</p>]]>

  <title>Sanyam Khurana - MozAMU: Mozilla Addons Development at AMU</title>

    <![CDATA[<p>It all started with PyCon India. I met a few students of Aligarh Muslim University who were trying to teach about FOSS in their college. A few them were already contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">Coala</a>. We talked a bit and they were discussing problems they were facing to run that community. I already started a Mozilla community at my college in the earlier days. Since I brought up a lot of folks from my college community in the event, we together discussed <em>How to nurture FOSS communities in college</em> as part of PyCon India Open Spaces. Here is a glimpse of the same:</p>
<img alt="PyCon India Open Spaces on how to nurture FOSS communities in college" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-1.jpeg" />
<p>Later, these folks were excited and invited me as a speaker at their college. A lot of planning happened for the event and we were in touch almost daily for different things. We planned the event one and a half month in advance. Finally, on 24th Feb 2018, we decided to have a full-day event around FOSS at Aligarh Muslim University.</p>
<p>We left from Delhi at around 6:30 AM in the morning. We then halted at a cafe known as <cite>Break Point</cite> around Aligarh to have breakfast. We reached the university at around 10:20 AM.</p>
<p>We took some time to test the entire set-up and the event began at around 11:30 AM. I took the first session on <strong>Why you should contribute to Open Source</strong>. We discussed the question that somehow pops up sooner or later into everyone's mind while contributing to Open Source: <strong>What's in it for me?</strong>.</p>
<p>We discussed various pathways one can begin contributing to Open Source Projects like <strong>coding, writing docs, managing team, advocacy, documentation, translation, bug triaging, reviews, organization skills, soft skills</strong> &amp; tons of other things that come as a by-product.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning about different contribution pathways in FOSS" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-9.jpg" />
<p>You can find the slides here: <a class="reference external" href="http://sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/why-foss">Why you should contribute to Open Source?</a>.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-2.jpg" />
<p>We had a break for sometime and then started with the much awaited <strong>Add-ons session</strong>. Everyone was very excited to start learning to develop add-ons. I began with explaining the initial setup details &amp; discussed JSON briefly to bring everyone on the same page. To make most out of the event, We also organized a few events previously to teach basics of JavaScript &amp; JSON so that students so that they do not feel overwhelmed with the add-ons development.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-3.jpg" />
<p>Then Shashank (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/realslimshanky">@realslimshanky</a>) took over and discussed <tt class="docutils literal">manifest.json</tt> and it's importance. Later we developed a simple addon -- borderify, which displays a border on every site the user visits. Some students also modified their scripts to make their add-ons do different things and posted them on twitter. Shashank, me and Shivam Singhal (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/championshuttler">@championshuttler</a>) helped everyone with their problems during the development phase.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees learning from Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-4.jpg" />
<p>Since all of us are devs, we were able to quickly resolve queries of students. One of the most important things I noticed is that often people misspell either the name of their manifest file or some key in their manifest people resulting their add-on to not load during the debugging phase.</p>
<p>A lot of them then created addons on their own and modified their previously created borderify addon to do more stuff. I've tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/CuriousLearner/1a4b08dbf642be8e4dfeb9544c9ab4c9">collect some of them here</a>. For a more verbose list you can visit Twitter and search tweets tagging me (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">@ErSanyamKhurana</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozAMU">#MozAMU</a>.</p>
<p>Imaginations ran wild and one of the attendee created an addon that replaces the word <tt class="docutils literal">Google</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">Mozilla</tt> on every web page. You can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/husainhz7/GoogleMozilla/">his hack here</a></p>
<p>To make the session more interesting we gave add-ons stickers to anyone who answers the question about what we were just telling them. A lot of folks praised and tweeted about the addons they were generating. We were able to generate <strong>10,000+ impressions with more than 4,000+ accounts reached on Twitter for #MozAMU</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on no of impressions created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-11.png" />
<img alt="Twitter Outreach report on top contributors created for #MozAMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-12.png" />
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="https://tweetreach.com/reports/20714737">read the full report here</a>.</p>
<p>Till this time, I never introduced to anyone about who am I and most importantly not listed any of my contributions in any of the projects. I don't want them to feel overwhelmed and assume that we people have some sort of superpowers that we're able to patch bugs in any FOSS project. I always make it a point to encourage them and help them land their first patch.</p>
<p>And my introduction summed that up in just one line <tt class="docutils literal">I'm one of you <span class="pre">--</span> a part of the community</tt>.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner) teaching about essential things to learn while contributing to FOSS projects" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-13.png" />
<p>We then hopped on to discuss <strong>How do I start contributing to Open Source?</strong> where we specifically discussed <strong>How to find bugs on different projects through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Enthusiastic folks learning about contributions for Sanyam Khurana (CuriousLearner)" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-7.jpg" />
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/#/">slides here</a>. Then I discussed other Open Source projects I've contributed to like <em>CPython, Django, Oppia, Mozilla's Devtools, Gecko-Engine &amp; tried to find out similarities in various bug trackers.</em> We then had a group photo with some of the attendees.</p>
<img alt="Group photo at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-5.jpg" />
<p>It was already 5 PM and we didn't go for Lunch since students kept us busy with their questions during the lunch break too :P</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic students asking questions in break" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-8.jpg" />
<p>So, we decided to hop-on to a restaurant nearby with the core-team of students that helped in organizing the event with so much enthusiasm.</p>
<img alt="Curious &amp; enthusiastic attendees at Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-10.jpg" />
<p>Then we clicked one last photo before leaving Aligarh at around 7:00 PM with the core-volunteers of the event who helped in all the preparations for the event.</p>
<img alt="Group photo Mozilla AMU" class="align-center" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-amu-6.jpg" />
<p>In the end, I would like to congratulate the students for making so wonderful arrangements and pushing up the FOSS community in their college. I hope they will now start landing patches in different FOSS projects &amp; we'll all meet again soon.</p>]]>

<p>During the fest, our volunteers met different age groups and found one thing common is that <em><strong>‘Language matters on the internet</strong></em>‘ and that’s why Localization is the important part of the web where it will open doors for all age groups where language is no more barriers.</p>

<p>In my every event I am always seeking for feedback’s from participants/attendees/visitors, doesn’t matter its positive or negative because if you know the feedback you can definitely work on it to improve for next time to make it better.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Feedback important?</strong> so I believe Feedback <span class="_Tgc _s8w">allows us to build and maintain communication with others and t</span>he most important information collected from post-event surveys is whether attendees found value in the event, whether it was worth their investment of time and resources, and whether they would participate in the event again.</p>

<p>The Squad for <strong>#MakerFest2018</strong> made sure people knew about the Web they are in, and how fast and far they can go if they go together. Often questioned, why are we doing this? We let them know that we are mere volunteers who are working to make the huge Web we are a part of, a healthier and a better place to be in! <img alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2764.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

Moreover, It is a platform where students get a chance to polish their skills and explore their potential. The Technical fest will comprise of Events, Exhibitions, Guest Lectures and a lot more, which aims to provide holistic exposure to students.</span><span id="more-1488"></span></p>
<p>Being Mozillian,  I believed that this event has a good potential to spread Mozilla mission so <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/girlscript-india-summit/">Mozilla Reps</a> have supported the event by giving a talk on Rust &amp; WebVR which are the most emerging technologies nowadays.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo_2018-02-23_23-34-01.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1491" height="540" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo_2018-02-23_23-34-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" width="720" /></a></p>
<p>Me(<a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/rowdymehul/">Mehul Patel</a>) &amp; <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/methwanishagufta/">Shagufta Methwani</a> are the speaker from Mozilla and gave a talk on Rust &amp; WebVR respectively.</p>

<p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">Started my talk by introducing them to Rust and why I’m using Rust? I believe, Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages. It also gives a relatively familiar tool to the modern C++ developers, but in the much more consistent and reliable ways.</span></p>
<p>I believe, new system programming language solves a lot of common system programming bugs. Moreover here we have Cargo: Rust Package manager which helps to Improve your toolkit. And, Its best for Self-learning &amp; always have fun to do.</p>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/rusthacks/RustHack/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits.</a></p>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>GNUnify is one of the amazing event where each and every year Mozilla India community make sure to participate. GNUnify is an annual gathering consisting of Free and Open Source software workshops, talks, seminars and BOFs (Birds of a feather), hosted by the Pune Linux User Group(PLUG) and the Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research(SICSR) in Pune, India. It is an amazing opportunity for people from FOSS communities all over India to meet each other and a good chance for newbies to find out how to get involved in FOSS projects and learn more about the free and open source culture. Mozilla has been actively participating at GNUnify since 2008!</p>
<p><img alt="GNUnify tracks" src="https://iamvp7.github.io//assets/2018/gnunify_18.jpg" /></p>
<p>This year along with the Mozilla contributors around pune I got opportunity to organise a workshop on WebExtension at GNUnify 2018. One of the main reason for my visit is to bring some more contributors to WebExtension community and bring more webdevelopers into WebExtension development.</p>
<p>Our Mozilla track was very strong we had some many topics to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>VR session by Prathamesh</li>
<li>Marathi localization session by Narendra</li>
<li>Cook up Firefox- Privacy Settings by Ankit</li>
<li>Rust session by Mehul</li>
<li>Hardware track by Tripad</li>
<li>WebExtensions Workshop by Viswaprasath</li>
</ul>
<p>In one room we had talks and in another room I was organising workshop. It was jam packed and very tight schedule, we Mozillians were not able to talk till 3 PM.</p>
<p>I was very excitied to talk on GNUnify, from 2015 (I wanted to talk about FirefoxOS previously) I wanted to give talk there as it was one of the big event we have related to open source technologies in India. As I got opportunity this year I was very happy to delivery it there.</p>
<p>I reached the venue sharply at 9:50 and was having some discussion with volunteers about the event in past and how it grew, the story they had about this event was amazing and it gave some more energy to me. And we started my session at 10:15, I started why we need WebExtension and backgrounds of it. But 10:35 the whole lab was filled with Students and Professors (I remember talking to 3 professor at middle of session and around 50 were there).</p>
<p>After some thoughts on WebExtension I showed them the demo of my favorite extension (Youtube controller), shared the story behind it. People got excited to know why I developed it, and the next one was to search a particular word in different search engine sites.</p>
<p>Around 11:15 we started to have hands-on session. First I started explaning them explaning about manifest.json and what are all the mandatory keys and values that has to be present, once they get familiar with it I started explaning the background.js file which we coded for our “search add-on”, using contextmenu. I showed the code sample with duckduckgo, but some of them understood the logic and tried to bring their favorite search engines (like Google, youtube, bing, wikipedia). Then we had a small break.  After this we developed another add-on where we will be having our own custom shortcut keys for close the tab.</p>
<p>The attendees were interested to learn more on hacking WebExtension API. One of the amazing unique thing they felt is they are able to build similar to browser internal features. They wanted to dig more and bring some amazing Extensions in future. The response from faculty and students is amazing. I had personal talk with students for more than a hour  and got chance to talk with Faculty who is handling Web Programming session. She shared it is interesting session and told she will ping back to discuss how WebExtensions can be made into their college syllabus.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Viswaprasath has started his workshop on Building one extension for all browsers with web extensions APIs! <a href="https://t.co/sFZZDO08Sa">pic.twitter.com/sFZZDO08Sa</a></p>

<p>In future I am sure, lot of amazing contributors will be coming as a effect of this event. One note which I came to know at the end of event is most of Reps from India who are present today came from this event.</p>
<p>I personally would like to thank all the Mozillians around Pune who made my day great and memorable one. Special thanks for the care shown by Prathamesh parenets, I didnt felt I am going for the first time to his home. The garden at their home is really good and well glued with nature. I am inspired a little bit by his father, may be in future will start gardening in my apartment.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>As you already know from our discourse topic, we have created an Onboarding Screening Team.</p>
<p>The scope of this team is to help on evaluating the new applications to the Reps program by helping the Reps Council on this process.</p>
<p>In January we opened a call for the new team members on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/do-you-want-join-the-onboarding-screening-team/24497">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/do-you-want-join-the-onboarding-screening-team/24497</a></p>
<p>We were happily surprised with the number of applications we’ve got.</p>
<p>After a month the Reps Council has voted and has chosen the new members. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mad_Maks/">Tim Maks van den Broek</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/vi5halc/">Vishal Chavan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/akayannick98/">Aka Brou Yannick N</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/gmontagu/">Gabriela Montagu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On behalf of the Reps Council (and part of this team) I want to say thank you to the previous team that worked on 9 rounds of screening with evaluation of 39 applications.</p>
<p>These amazing people are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/michaelkohler/">Michael Kohler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mijanur/">Mijanur Rahman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mte90/">Daniele Scasciafratte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/hossainalikram/">Hossain Al Ikram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The new team will start to work soon (we have about 10 applications in queue) with the help of a Reps Council Member that will be focused on communications between applicants and the evaluation of this team.</p>
<p>If you want to congratulate your fellows Reps you can do it in this thread:</p>

You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.”</em></p>

<p><em>Normally</em> people became ‘<em>lazy</em>‘ or ‘<em>sleepy</em>‘ after having lunch and moreover, if you get delicious Gujarati food then you can’t resist yourself to have. Upon that my talk was the first in line after lunch break so to having that in mind I have changed my talk style and from the start only I have tried to make the session interactive so the audience can also be part and their mind can be diverted. Guess what, It worked and people loved the interaction period. All an all we have a very healthy conversation during the session.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>A Saturday well spent teaching students about Open Source, Add-ons and Privacy.</p>
<p>We had an activity at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)
for Addons, WoMoz and Privacy.</p>
<p>The session started with Trishul giving a talk on getting started with Add-ons.
He explained about Web Extensions and how they are useful. He also depicted some
of the extensions built by the community. He explained the use of <tt class="docutils literal">manifest</tt>
file and then students started making simple add-ons on their own. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension">borderify</a>
Web Extension was chosen to teach students. Me, Trishul and Shivam helped them
whenever they were stuck.</p>
<img alt="Web Extension session" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons.jpg" />
<p>The next session was took by Faye on Women in Mozilla and how we can improve the
no of women contributors in the community.</p>
<img alt="Faye engaging participants" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-addons-faye.jpg" />
<p>The third session was took by me where I discussed about <cite>What is FOSS</cite> and why
people should contribute to FOSS. We then discussed on various pathways one can
start contributing. We also discussed on finding bugs through BugZilla and Bugsahoy
for Mozilla.</p>
<p>Then Shashikanth discussed about importance of Privacy issues.</p>
<p>We ended the event with a capture of all enthusiastic faces in the meetup:</p>

  <title>Sanyam Khurana - Moz-Fedora Day</title>

    <![CDATA[<p>We recently organized Moz-Fedora Day, a one day event on promoting FOSS through
Mozilla &amp; Fedora at Investopad, Hauz Khas, Delhi on Jan 13, 2018. The aim was
to depict the usage of packaging &amp; building one of the Mozilla's project using Fedora.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam explaining about Mozilla &amp; it's mission" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-4.jpg" />
<p>The core event focused on making the participants automate the build of any of
the Mozilla's open source project of their choice. The aim is to influence
people to switch to Linux as a build environment (We used Fedora for this)
and introduce the basics of the version control system (Mercurial in case of Mozilla).
The event will also introduce to Vagrant for running standardized virtual
machines for build environments.</p>
<img alt="Sanyam engaging participants on Moz-Fedora Day" src="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/feeds/images/moz-fedora-day-3.jpg" />
<p>The session began with Saurabh representing a bit about Fedora and other Linux
Distributions. I discussed about Mozilla, it's mission and different projects.
We then decided to package <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> in Fedora and guided
folks through the steps to build the system. We used simple Vagrant setup to

<p>Most of this was a hands-on session and I saw new faces who were truly excited to
learn about these things. A Saturday well spent, spreading the love of Open Source.</p>]]>

  <title>Official Reps Blog - Reps Council at Austin</title>

    <![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><em>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco"> All Hands Wiki page</a> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about what 2018 planning. One of our main topics was about the Mission Driven Mozillians proposal.</em></p>
<h2>Hot Topics</h2>
<p>As you already know, we asked in the past for your input on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/your-input-on-open-questions-for-mission-driven-mozillians-project/22388/">discourse</a> (if you’re not already subscribed to the Reps category, maybe now it’s the right moment)</p>
<p>Before we start with the recap of the week, we would like to say thank you to the Reps that left feedbacks on that thread (Felipe, Edoardo and André) but also all to the Mozillians on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/</a> that left their feedbacks too.</p>
<p>These suggestions were very important and on shaping the document that will be available soon (we had more discussions during the All Hands so the new revised version is not yet ready).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.18.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-524" height="252" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.18-252x252.jpg" width="252" /></a></p>
<p>Mission Driven Mozillians was the major topic on the Reps Council meetings. After consulting the results of Communities and Contributors Qualitative Survey we shaped the following questions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Reps program really a representative of all the mozillian communities?</li>
<li>How does the program need to evolve to engage more with our members?</li>
<li>How can we get new Reps to join the new Coach and Resources initiatives?</li>
<li>How can we improve the use of the report tool by our Reps?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plans for 2018</h2>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_523" style="width: 262px;"><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/austin.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-523" height="336" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/austin-252x336.jpg" width="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A photo with: Reps Peers, Reps Council (missing Prathamesh and Elio), Kiki (the awesome girl that manage all our budget/swag requests) and Manel (an unexpected guest during the photo shoot)</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving forward, our plan is to deep dive into those because and also start acting on them.</p>
<p>The council also highly engaged with the Leadership proposal (that had a high priority) since it will be the base on how Mozilla communities will be shaped in the near future and will of course influence our program.</p>
<p>Open by Design was the motto of this All Hands during all the meetings inside Open Innovation, but also across the organization. You see Mozilla has a strong value that the other IT companies don’t have: the community.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_525" style="width: 262px;"><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.24.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-525" height="252" src="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.24-252x252.jpg" width="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla is more than a Silicon Valley IT company</p></div>
<p>One of the most curious and interesting, for the purpose of openness, thing is the ability to access  official Mozilla Slack channels for all the mozillians with NDA to. This support enables the volunteers to be able to communicate directly with the employees. And Yes, as Reps you have already signed the NDA so you can access without problems the various channels!</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>We had <tt class="docutils literal">MozCoffee Delhi</tt> on last Saturday, Dec 23, 2017. We had a lot of Rep
Attendees this time with other Mozillians. What would have been a better way to
end an year than the MozCoffee. From past various months, the activities in
Mozilla Delhi came to a stand still. But then we had MozCoffee planned in less
than a week. Thanks to my new mentor Trishul for arranging MozCoffee at Chaayos,
Connaught Place, New Delhi on 23rd December, 2017.</p>
<p>We gathered up at the venue in the evening and met a lot of new and old people.
We had Trishul, Faye, Sanyam, Tanzeel, Dvyik, Rajiv, Saurabh, Pushpita, Shivam, Tushar at the meetup.</p>
<p>The discussion started with Trishul explaining about his experience in All Hands Austin.
He told about various projects that have been identified by Mozilla as the major
areas of contributions. We discussed about both tech &amp; non-tech contributions
in various areas.</p>
<p>Near the end of the event, Trishul also helped me in explaining about addons.
Since I've previous experience with JS, it was pretty easy to pick that stuff up.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some amazing photographs which would now become a memory for all of us.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>2017 is one of the amazing year I had. I have dedicated it fully to  learn and share my knowledge about WebExtension and develop some WebExtension during my free time.</p>
<h1 id="january">January</h1>
<p>This is one of the best month and very good start of the year. In Tamilnadu we had lot of problems but we succesfully organised our first ever MozillaTN meetup, yes we were having amazing two day event where I was helping attendees to know about WebExtension. Before even the meetup some of the attendees started learning webextension, thanks to MDN and some of the articles I wrote <img alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<h1 id="february">February</h1>
<p>This is one of the milestone month for me, I got an opportunity to share about WebExtension in our local ILUGC meetup.  ILUGC is one of the amazing community which is having the regular meetups for past 10+ years. Giving session there was really amazing and was an exciting one for me. Then at the last week I was able to visit SRM Univ after a long time and gave some basic introduction talk on WebExtension and Mozilla Community.</p>
<h1 id="march">March</h1>
<p>In march our MozillaTN community organised our first ever over night hackathon at KCG college of Technology chennai. We had 2 tracks WebVR and WebExtension. I was handling the WebExtension session and was mentoring the students on how to build it, and it is also my first hackathon with WebExtension development. Then  on the last week went to VIT chennai to share about WebExtension, It was one day session where introduced students with WebExtension and also had some coding session to develop a small addon to close the tab on click of browserAction button.</p>
<p>Between April and June sometime I was involved in developing some add-ons and wrote blog posts about them.</p>
<h1 id="july">July</h1>
<p>Went to KCG Community space and shared about WebExtension development. We had the half a session to understand about Tabs API.</p>
<p>And early July I started planning about WebExtension on-line series where planned to create vidoes and train attendes one API per day and discuss about them on how to use it for developing WebExtension.</p>
<h1 id="august">August</h1>
<p>Went Dhirajzilla engineering college at Salem and gave an introduction talk about WebExtension. The biggest gift and surprise I got from the students I was able to meet my under graduate professor there. That was the happiest moment and I was giving talk in front of my professor about WebExtension. She was amazing person and inspired us a lot, she played a major role in shaping me and my friends during our college days. And went to Sairam college to have a booth and tell students about Mozilla communities in booth and gave a short quick talk Why WebExtension are amazing.</p>
<h1 id="september">September</h1>
<p>This is one of the good month. We planned a good open hackaton (any students, employees can join) at out KCG community space. This is the first open hackathon in that community space and around 20+ attendees attended and demoed 6+ addons. Went to another hackathon at SNS College of Tech Coimbatore, where had amazing set of students with good knowledge of what they are going to develop.</p>
<h1 id="october">October</h1>
<p>SRM university approached us and wanted to have a good purely technical hands-on session. This time we had 2 days session again (my 3rd one in a row). I was showing different demo and people loved contextMenu and omnibar search and most of them showed demo on it. And they were interested in learning it continously and the guy who hosted us was amazing, thanks to Anirudh for this opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="november">November</h1>
<p>In November after a long time had opportunity to talk at over night hackathon along with Santhosh, Karthick, Trishul. It was amazing to see kids right from 13 years. Some of them showed amazing demo like text-to-speech using Web APIs. It was cool at the same time was so tired.</p>
<h1 id="december">December</h1>
<p>Yes its year end and everything is bit slow. I got opportunity to attend All hands at Austin. I met amazing Mozillians and had lot of learning. Went to awesome dinner and Star wars <img alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /><br />

Ce nouveau modèle d’extensions multinavigateur était devenu exclusif dans Firefox quelques jours plus tôt. Une soirée de présentation a précédé la journée de programmation de ces extensions.</p>
<p>Pour préparer le hackathon, il fallait une soirée de lancement.</p>    <p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/conf-meetup.jpg" title="Salle conférence à Mozilla Paris"><img alt="Salle conférence à Mozilla Paris" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.conf-meetup_m.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></a></p>

<p>Ce hackathon sous le signe du portage et de la migration des extensions a été introduit par deux présentations.</p>

<p>Tout d’abord, notre Mozillien Christophe Villeneuve a montré comment porter les extensions développées pour Chrome vers Firefox. Il a listé les erreurs couramment rencontrées lors de ces opérations. Vous pouvez retrouver ses diapos (<i lang="en">slides</i>) :</p>

<p>Ensuite, Marc de <a href="https://www.lilo.org/fr/" hreflang="fr" title="Lilo moteur de recherche">Lilo</a> a partagé son expérience dans le développement d’extensions pour un moteur de recherche « qui finance des projets sociaux et environnementaux ». Il a justifié ses choix techniques face aux  contraintes de son service et des navigateurs pris en charge.</p>

<p>Enfin, il a été temps pour les participants de proposer leurs envies, manques, besoin aux <i lang="en">hackers</i> du lendemain.</p>

<p><img alt="idées pour le hackathon" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.idees_m.jpg" style="display: table; margin: 0 auto;" /><br />
<em style="display: block; text-align: center;">Extrait des idées des participants</em></p>

<p>Après une courte nuit, les participants sont revenus avec beaucoup d’idées suite aux différentes conversations de la veille.</p>

<p>Au cours de la journée, les développements ont été très variés, avec une pause en milieu de journée pour reprendre des forces. Voici une petite liste des projets en cours établie en fin de journée :</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/midi.jpg"><img alt="repas du midi" src="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/.midi_m.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 150px;" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Tamper proxy (anciennement Tamper Data) : monitoring de requête</li>
<li>Top Word  : un outil pour analyser le nombre de mots employés dans une page et les classer</li>
<li>Aria Liner : une extension d’accessibilité</li>
<li>Un cloneur de contenu</li>
<li>Une extension pour communiquer avec le site liveslide.io</li>
<li>DevTools PHP : un débogueur PHP dans la console</li>
</ul>

<p>Ce fut l’occasion pour les participants d’apprendre à créer les extensions. Ils vont continuer le développement pour pouvoir les mettre prochainement dans le <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/" hreflang="fr" title="Site des extensions de Firefox">dépôt site des extensions</a> de Mozilla.</p>

<p>Nous sommes sûrs que certains projets verront le jour très rapidement.</p>

<p>En outre, les idées proposées et non retenues ne sont pas perdues. Elles ont été envoyées sur le <a href="https://github.com/firefox-addons/ideas/issues" hreflang="en" title="dépôt communautaire des extensions">dépôt communautaire</a>. La communauté des extensions pourra s’en inspirer pour en réaliser une.</p>

<p>Après ce marathon, les organisateurs ont reçu des demandes pour refaire un événement de ce type. Ils ont été sensibles à cette forte demande… Ce sera pour 2018. Alors, à suivre…</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Event was the follow-up of <a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/">MozAarambh</a> . Students were very much excited to know about the Virtual reality  in our previous event. So we went again with A-frame and WebVR through WebVR Camp.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/11/30/webvr-camp-jru-ranchi/23795755_1911531268862619_2431737216961862571_n/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/23795755_1911531268862619_2431737216961862571_n.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150" width="113" /></a>

<p>Event started with a warm welcome and introduction of WebVR. We have distributed Aframe postcards , thanks for the wonderful cheatsheet, to all the attendees so that they get to know about Aframe and WebVR in detail and how to get involved in it. With the brief walkthrough of agenda we went to the Computer Lab where the actual fun begun.</p>

<p>We started with the hello world example of A-frame, later everyone was able to mix and make their own hello world .</p>

<p>All the projects developed during this event need few finishing after that we’ll be hosting them to a central repository. We are happy to see great ethusiasm among the students of Jharkhand Rai University, got to know more about the problems they had earlier too, I hope I’ll be able to fix few of them and with the support of the community we’ll make this Jharkhand community a productive one.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m
on my flight back from London where I had the pleasure to assist to the Mozilla
Festival 2017. I’ll try to use this 2 hours of my flight time to relate to you
how my experience was before and during it as well as the things that really
impressed me of it.</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to the first beginning of the
Festival, Friday 27 at 5:00 a.m. On that time, I was just waking up after
getting only a few hours of sleep because of all the excitement I was having
for the festival, so I got dressed up as a zombie and after a really fast
breakfast that consisted on the remaining cookies of the pantry and a really
hot coffee that seemed like magma, I headed towards the airport. There, some
boring and long queues where waiting for me, as well as, the not well-received
security checkpoint where I had to take from my bag all the electronic things I
had on it (More than half of a dozen, I think the security guy got crazy when
he saw it). Finally, I made it into the plane and I headed towards London.</p>

<p>Once there, I
used all the time I had until the festival to do some sightseeing in London and
visit the typical places you usually go as a Tourist like the Big Ben, the
London Eye or the Queen’s Castle (With the famous queen’s guards on it). Also,
I tried the so famous “Fish and Chips”.</p>

<p>After all of
this, it arrived the time, the time to go the Mozilla Festival in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p><b><i>A few
minutes later</i></b></p>

<p>I saw the Ravensbourne building after a few
minutes going around, so big, so squarish, full of strange circles on it… I
went inside and I proceeded with the Check-In process where I got my Lanyard
and I went inside of it.  The first day
it was a Networking event, I didn’t really get involved with it because it was
my first Networking event ever and I felt like a fish out of water. Eventually
I got the essence of it and I started meeting some great people there like
Florian, Konstantina, Ayah, as well as, my mentor Michael.  After it, we had dinner in a nearby restaurant
and I headed back towards the hostel.
First day was over…</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up, 7 a.m. After
some improvised breakfast in the hostel, I went to Ravensbourne, today it was
the day to start with the sessions. I went to sessions about confidence, others
about Privacy and also, I attended a really interesting talk about
Matrix.org.  The lunch time was also kind
of Networking so I tried to engage in different conversations with people
around me, amazing time.</p>

<p>At night, Mozilla organized a party on the
Royal Society of Arts (RSA) where there was some electronic music by a guy
dressed like Tron, with really futuristic design and music. There was also some
comedy on the Auditory, it was a great night but I headed back sooner than I
expected because I felt really tired of all day sessions.</p>

<p>Third and Last day… We started the day with
a Networking Breakfast in Ravensbourne sponsored by Flattr (You should check
them out, they have great ideas). After it, I decided to go around and try the
different stuff available on it instead of going to more sessions. There, I had
the pleasure to try a great VR game about some experiments that took place in
the military, also, I got to know about The Data Detox Bar and a bunch of other
great stuff there to.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time to go, so I had to say
bye to all the people I met during the festival day and I headed to the train
(Funny story here, due to the time change, the app became crazy and it changed
my whole schedule. I decided to trust my gut and I followed my prescheduled
journey hoping to don’t lose the flight. It worked and after some crazy runs up
and down the London Bridge station, I made it into the train and I headed
towards the Airport. It was time to go back home.</p>]]>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://kelimuttu.github.io/rep-resources-training/">blog post</a>, I wrote about the learnings that we got from the initial training session. And last Friday, we just <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/resources-track-applications-are-now-open/18367/12?u=rizki_kelimutu">announced</a> the new graduates from the final phase of Resources Rep training. The assessment was made during the 3 weeks of the training (whether group or individual exercises) that started on the 2nd of October until 21st of October 2017. You can also see the full list of the Rep Resources graduates in the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">Reps portal</a>. But I would like to quickly take you back on the initial purpose of Resources Reps.</p>
<p><b>What is a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>The idea behind the Resources Reps  is to have specialized Reps who are trained to help communities and other fellow Reps to plan strategically how they use the resources that the Reps program offers. This will ensures that resources of the program are used in the most impactful way and according to the<a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/budget-allocation-q1-2/14650"> guidance</a> provided by Mozilla’s strategy and the Council.</p>
<p><b>When did the training happened?</b></p>
<p>The training sessions happened in 3 phases. The first one, which was the trial training, happened during 24th of July – 12th of August 2017. We asked  6 Reps to participate on this trial session to help us improve the training. After the trial training, we then opened the application for the rest of the Reps and decided to carry on with the first phase of the training with the India applicants during 11th of September – 1st of October. Finally, the last phase happened on the 2nd of October – 21st of October.</p>
<p>During the 3 weeks of the training, the candidates were asked to go through the training material and complete the quiz every  week. And in the end of each week (we decided to have the meeting on the weekend), we scheduled a video meeting for an hour in order to have work and discuss on the subject together.</p>
<p><b>What did we learn from the overall training?</b></p>
<p>On the trial training, the participants helped  a lot in terms of improving the content of the training. Thanks to them, now we have the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Budget/Receipts_guide">receipt guideline</a> to help the Rep identify which receipts are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>On the first phase of the training with Reps from India, we were experimenting with a new video conference tool, which surprisingly performed so much better than the tool that we usually use.</p>
<p>And on the second phase, I learned a lot about accessibility issues. Since we need to accommodate so many time zones, I decided to break the meeting into 2 sessions in each weekend. The first session is for the Asia, Europe, and Africa, and the other session is for the Pacific people who lived in North or South America.</p>
<p>The first meeting was rather challenging since we had people with problems on communication (more specifically a deaf participant and a person that was not able to follow up in English). This came to me as a shock, because that was something I was not prepared for. But fortunately, with some love of the local community, we were able to have an effective meeting. It’s super amazing to see how people were willing to help each other in the training. It was also a reminder for me to think about accessibility in advance for our future activities. For example like providing dial in details for a meeting could be so much beneficial for some people who don’t have access to a PC and can only join via phone. Or checking on the participants before the meeting in case there’s somebody who need special support. Because if we want to excel on diversity and inclusion, then we need to take further action to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p><b>How can I apply to be a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>For now we’re in the process of evaluating our current graduates. So in the meantime, we are not accepting more applications. But there’s a possibility we will reopen the application in the future. We’ll let you know for sure.</p>
<p><b>What’s next?</b></p>
<p>New Reps that  don’t have access to the budget and swag, can now ask for help from these <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Resources">Resources Rep</a>. We will no longer need to assign the bug to the mentor if the request was made by a Resources Rep. And instead it will go directly to the review team. And ideally, the new Reps should choose Resources Rep who’s close to their region. So, for example if I’m a new Rep from the US, I will ask for help from <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/hashrocket/">Jason</a> who in this case is the Resources Rep who live the closest to me. You can also see the group on the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">reps portal</a>.</p>
<p>We’re also going to reshuffle the Review Team members in the near future. The Review Team is now discussing the recommendation list from the current Resources Rep to be sent to the council for the future candidates of the Review team. We’ll keep you updated for the process.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank the participants of the Resources Rep training. And especially for those who always make the time on their weekend to join the meeting in each week. Congratulations!</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>I was in high school,
sitting in the Computers room, taking part of a boring and monotonous class
about Office IT. Because of that, I decided to open Firefox and start surfing
the web for some entertainment to make the time passed faster. So, I clicked in
the Firefox logo, Firefox popped-up and as soon as it opened, I realized about of
a yellow square at the bottom of Firefox asking me to took part of Mozilla and
become a volunteer. </p>



<p>In that moment, I
was dubitative because I didn’t really know what to do or if it was worth it
but I recalled a conversation I had with my best friend at that time about
Mozilla and its principles and decided to give it a try… I pressed the yellow
squared button and it redirected me into a webpage that showed me all the activities
I could join  (Labs, Localization,
Coding, Marketing, QA…).   After a few minutes, I decided that I wanted
to help with QA, testing some products as Firefox Beta, Firefox Nightly or the now
ceased Firefox Aurora because I wanted to make Firefox a better browser with
less bugs and more stability. </p>



<p>Once I clicked
it, it opened my email prompting me to write an E-Mail to the responsible of QA
Area in Mozilla Hispano (who I would know later as Gabriela) stating that I
wanted to contribute in that area and the reasons for it.  I wrote the email and she quickly answered it giving
me some tasks to do in Teambox (A site we used in order to organize tasks and
activities) as well as giving me some mentorship so I could start helping as
fast as possible. </p>

<p> Time passed really
quick and I went from being a newcomer to be part as a member of Mozilla without
with no more mentorship. Anyway, I kept in touch with Gabriela because she was my
friend and still the responsible of the area. As time passed by, I saw a drop
in the participation of the QA area so I proposed Gabriela a new scheme for it.
She really liked the idea and she decided to offer me the possibility of being
co-responsible of the area so I could help her with all the task involved which
I clearly accepted.  

</p><p> A year passed
without a lot of changes, I routinely participated in the friday testdays about
Firefox Beta, we also organized an amazing Spanish testday which was
well-received and well-appreciated for the Hispanic contributors of Mozilla and
I tried to help in other areas like Marketing or Localization.

</p><p> One day, I saw a
notification about a QA/Localization hackathon that would take part in Paris somewhere
near November 2015. The idea of going to Paris to the Mozilla Office really
fascinated me and I applied as fast as I could, wishing to be selected for it
so I could have the opportunity to meet other people as passionate as I for
Mozilla. Somehow, my wishes became true and I got the chance to travel to Paris
and meet some contributors there like Facyber (My great friend Marko) or
Marcia, a nice woman from Mozilla which I only had the pleasure to talk by iRC
and the one who taught us all she could about FirefoxOS in the short time of
two days. It was a really great experience.

</p><p>Sadly, one day,
Mozilla decided to cut off Firefox OS, and that decision took with it some ups
and downs which made some contributors leave the community because they didn’t
see a clear orientation or a clear focus and all the communities of Mozilla around
the world saw a big break on its activities. In that moment, I was really busy
studying for the exams of the university and other stuff so I became really inactive
for a few months and I did not really see what was coming. </p>



<p>Once I returned,
I realized how everything was stopped and I felt really guilty for it. For that
reason, some contributors and I decided that it was time to relaunch the
community and we got down to work for it. At first, we took some surveys and we
decided some goals for the community but this approach didn’t clearly work out,
so some months later, we decided to take it back and we proposed some interesting
new projects to work on and as of today, it seems it has worked because we got
new projects and new contributors working on them. </p>



<p>To conclude, I
have to add that after relaunching the community, I got really motivated so I
decided that it was time to step up and apply to become a Mozilla Rep as other
people recommended me.</p>]]>

    <![CDATA[<p>I started my journey in Mozilla as a contributor to Mozilla Community Rajasthan and met many enthusiasts who inspired me to do  every possible contributions i could do to Mozilla and Open source in general. I am from Jharkhand , after returning from Rajasthan, I met a mozillian from Jharkhand community, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/amitsin6h/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amit Singh</a> , he is very passionate about learning new things and very much like the idea of working in open.</p>
<p>I got to know many problems of the people wanted to contribute. Major problem is the availability of support from Mozilla and Mozilla Reps in general. There are many Reps from this region , but unfortunatly they are working outside this state. They are very helpful in arranging things, but… But they want their presence, they want to hear them in person and want to know their success story, how they came to mozilla and why….. There are many more questions asked by few contributors who wanted to continue the same. I listed their questions and figured out many possible things we could do together to improve the contributions from this region.</p>
<p>I moved to Ranchi officially , it was the time when i was very busy with my work. A phone call rang, it was Amit , wanted to know if i can organize an event in Jharkhand Rai University. I said yes, definitely . He introduced me to Prof. Shudhanshu, after meeting him we fixed the date, 6th Oct. 2017. Made a poster , promoted in Jharkahnd Rai University.</p>
<p><img alt="MozAarambh Poster" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/mozaarambh-poster.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Event day, we reached the venue on time, we received a warm welcome. Prof. Shudhanshu introduced us infornt of students. I see a hall, full pacekd with students almost 200+ . I introduced myself  and why I choose to contribute to Mozilla and Open source. Students were listening this as if they were sitting in a lecture room. It was the tme to bring out few swags , in a minute everyone was answering questions, asking interesting questions. <strong>Swag has some power!!!!!</strong></p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/photo6282760985194375150/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/photo6282760985194375150.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p>I started with introduction of Mozilla, Firefox and Open Source. To my surprise everyone knows about these things. Then I got to know that they had one introduction event of mozilla but after that never heard back from that mozillian. Then I introduced them about the mozilla’s products and projects, what actually matters. People were very excited to know about WebVR, Rust and WebCompat .</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/photo6282760985194375158/"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="113" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/photo6282760985194375158.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113" width="150" /></a>

<p>I forgot to introduce the speakers, I had Amit and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Malam1212/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mahtab</a> with me who was sharing the stage. Amit gave session on WebCompat and even showed a demo on how to file a report. Mahtab gave session on L10n and how a non-coder students still contribute to open source.</p>

<p>Event concluded with a group picture. A mozilla style of conclusion!!</p>
<p><img alt="photo6282760985194375143" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="https://alamshahbaz.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/photo6282760985194375143.jpg?w=788" /></p>
<p>Actual thing happend after the event , there were 80 students who wanted to know the possibilities and ways to involve with Mozilla and it’s projects. We get back to the hall ,selected few students who have shown their interest in making a club. I introduced Mozilla Campus Club to them. We formed a team and created Telegram groups so that we stay in loop.</p>

<p>Mozilla Jharkhand has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozilla.jharkhand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">facebook group</a> and after the event people joined this group in hige number, from 170 we reached to 246 in a single day. Not only they joined in this group, they have introduced themself to this group, which i never seen in other community as this scale. This shows they are very active and only need a correct Mentor to guide them.</p>
<p>I will love to do the role of Mentor to them. And next day we were rocking on local newspaper. Planning a series of events in this college to educate them and make a good contributor.</p>

<p><strong>Can you have a way to detect which tab has the playlist open? If I have two tabs with two different playlists which one will be affected by the addon actions?</strong><br />
<em>ya you found the problem rcmainak .. it will affect all the tabs. becoze we are querying all the tabs and iterating all the tabs. it will be awesome if any one of us work on this, like showing the list of tabs (by title of song) and execute script on the required tab</em></p>

<p><strong>IRC channel</strong>: #MozillaTN</p>
<p>This is our first series of the WebExtension webseries. The main agenda of the program is to get started with Mozilla community and discuss the syllabus we will be learning in this series.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//MozWOC-Session4">previous session</a> we get started learning what are tabs API. There are lot of cases where we have used Tabs API and published add-ons on it. We will slowly cover tabs API one by one along with Different API.</p>
<p>In the fifth session we are going to learn one of the use case of omnibox using Tabs.create API.</p>
<h4 id="todays-problem-statement">Todays Problem statement</h4>
<p>In the address of Firefox / Google Chrome what happens is when we enter some words we will be getting the results from default search engine. but we will some times require to search on different site. say you know my handle in twitter is @iamvp7 so there are two ways goto twitter.com and search my handle (or) goto search engine search my handle with twitter keyword.. so it sometime gets bored. so we will build a small add-on which will<br />
be helpful for us.</p>
<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>
<p><strong>Building simple Multi Search Add-on</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>learn about omnibox API. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox">MDN docs</a></li>
<li>learn about Tabs create API <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/create">MDN docs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get started with omnibox API &amp; Tabs.Create API from the following video.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>All the code samples discussed in the above video is available in the <a href="https://github.com/iamVP7/MozWOC17/tree/master/session5">github</a> and the detailed blog post on this particular API is shared before. <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//Build-Quick-Search-In-Firefox-Using-WebExtensions/">Link of post</a></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>We wanted to make a strong community in Chennai. We got this wonderful place KCG E-cell. Lot of planning went around this event, and we planned event month before.</p>
<p><strong>Organiser</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sayajis</li>
<li>Vishal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mozilla Reps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Viswaprasath</li>
<li>Dinesh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developer Mentor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prasanth</li>
<li>Balaji</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most succesfully thing is Balaji was excited to become Mentor for this Session. He has recently started developing Add-ons and was part of recent <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//WebExtension-IRC-Learning/">Weeks of Contribution</a>.</p>
<p>We did a minimal marketing with our Telegram group and Mailing list, our main agenda is to bring max of 30 contributors and who are interested to contribute for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>This is the first time I am collaborating with Dinesh in Tamilnadu. He started sharing the path he came across Mozilla community, how he started learning and how he got help from contributor who are in other part of world.</p>
<p>Our Agenda is very simple.</p>
<p>For Day1</p>
<ul>
<li>Share about WebExtension</li>
<li>Explore various API</li>
<li>Start discussing on ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>For Day2</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on the ideas we have.</li>
<li>Demo (show &amp; tell)</li>
</ul>
<p>We started discussing about WebExtension with the attendees came. I was very energetic and happy to discuss about WebExtension. Some of the examples I discussed on this session is</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iamVP7/MyExtensions/tree/master/youtube-control">Youtube Controller</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iamVP7/MyExtensions/tree/master/search-more/Firefox">Search More using ContextMenu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iamVP7/MyExtensions/tree/master/multisearch/Firefox">Multi Search using OmniBox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we had a lunch.</p>
<p>After that shared my code <a href="https://github.com/iamVP7/MyExtensions">repo</a> and asked everyone to dig the code. In the mean time Balaji and Dinesh were working on collecting some interesting Add-ons ideas on which contributors can work on.</p>
<p>One of the Contributor who attended the event Sanjay told, the below feedback</p>
<p><strong>There should be some resources where all of us can learn the basics step by step. The resources can be shared before event so, when we come to venue we can get to know what we are going to do and start discussing directly and start our coding part</strong></p>
<p>I loved his suggestion and same suggestion was given by Karthick long back, we started to work on a book which is expected to be released soon. And currenty structuring the contents which will be easier to learn step by step and making it as a website.</p>
<p>Then before we leaving home everyone started sharing our ideas one by one.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-disucssed-by-attendees">Ideas disucssed by attendees</h2>
<ul>
<li>History Deleter by monisha,nandhini</li>
<li>One Click games by amirtha,karthika</li>
<li>Google Search by amirtha,karthika</li>
<li>Remindyou by Pavan</li>
<li>NextPlease by Abdulla P I</li>
<li>Go Directly/ Dont Search by Akash Milton</li>
<li>Bold it by Balaji</li>
<li>Disc Lyric by Subhashini Gopal</li>
<li>Live Editor by Balaji B</li>
<li>Tabs Grouping by Sanjay</li>
<li>Facebook Message in browserAction</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we organisers, mentors and reps went for a dinner.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p>We started our Day 2 around 10.00 AM. We started discussing about the ideas the we had and everyone started learning the API from MDN.</p>
<p>Then Abdulla, finished his Addon using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/commands">Commands API</a>. His ideas is to move to next page of google search using simple keyboard shortcuts.<br />
Ctrl + some key to next page and previous page. Then Abdulla started mentoring others who are new to Javascript.</p>
<p>By After we had following demo.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/go-direct/">Go Direct</a> by Akash Milton, where we search some text and go directly to website.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-editor/">Live Editor</a> by Balaji B.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/time-out-for-your-tasks/">Time out</a> by Balaji B.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of partial demo. (Not in AMO)</p>
<ul>
<li>One Click Games (using Tabs.open API)</li>
<li>Google Search (using omnibox API and Tabs.open)</li>
<li>Tabs Grouping.</li>
<li>Specific Domain History Deleter</li>
</ul>
<p>The final part where screwed up was, show and Tell. The plan is to bring all the attendees share the demo and make them to explain the code they have done.<br />
But due to the power problem on the second day we are not able to do it. If it had happened then we might had the best hackathon.</p>
<h3 id="some-good-numbers-we-had">Some good numbers we had.</h3>
<ul>
<li>20 Contributors joined.</li>
<li>7 Add-ons developed</li>
<li>3 Addons currently in AMO</li>
<li>2 New Young mentors( Abdulla, Balaji)</li>
<li>1 Experience Mentors (Sanjay)</li>

  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">The event is focused on introducing and teaching the state of art system programming language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust</a> to local programmers and Mozillians in Gujarat.  This is the first time <strong>Mozilla</strong> will participate at <strong>ORDINATEUR’17</strong>! The summit will involve students and tech enthusiasts from the university. I gave a talk on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust programming</a> which is one of emerging technologies and one of the major focus of Mozilla.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>About ORDINATEUR’17 :</strong></p>
<p>ORDINATEUR’17 is a one of a kind flagship event organized by IEEE GCET Computer Society Student Chapter under the them “<strong><em>Tech Trend &amp; Innovate</em></strong>”</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420" height="267" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/poster.jpg?resize=720%2C267" width="720" /></a>Before, I shared my experience with this talk, so let me tell you one thing that this was my one of the best intellectual programming debate talk. Yes, it is! <img alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f600.png" style="height: 1em;" /><span id="more-1416"></span></p>
<p>I have started with Introduction to Mozilla and “Who am I”. Adding to that, I have also shared about Mozilla projects and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust </a>is one of them. So now, Lets Dive Into Rust!</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8975.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1421" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8975.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a><br />
According to me, <em>Rust is a good choice when you’d choose C++. You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why should I use Rust? </strong></em>I am always expecting this question whenever I talk about Rust and here as well one language enthusiast asked me the same questions.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, I have shared the reason that I’ve looked into Rust at first and then I have explained and discussed each point with participants.  </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_04-10-17.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_04-10-17.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages</li>
<li>It is low-level enough that you take account of most resources.</li>
<li>It’s more like C++ and Go, less like Node and Ruby</li>
<li>cargo is awesome. Managing crates just works as intended, which makes a whole lot of troubles you may have in other languages just vanish with a satisfying <em>poof</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8938.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1422" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8938.jpg?resize=720%2C480" width="720" /></a>It was always fun to play with Rust and glad that participants also enjoyed while rusty their hand.</p>

  <title>Mehul Patel - Why Open Source ?</title>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.rowdymehul.com/?p=1406</guid>
  <link>http://www.rowdymehul.com/mozilla/why-open-source/</link>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Firstly, let me extend the thanks to <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">Yuvalay Electronics Lab</a> for inviting me as Speaker to give a talk on Open Source. Moreover, kudos to you to arrange a talk on Open source first time ever in <span class="_Xbe">Vadodara</span> city.</p>
<p><strong>About Yuvalay Electronics Lab</strong></p>
<p>Yuvalay Electronics Lab offers a platform and eco-system to the students, hobbyists, and professionals to understand and apply the theoretical knowledge of the subjects in the field of Electronics. It helps to convert the interest into the passion by providing a conducive environment to learn-explore-innovate under the guidance of experts. <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">More</a></p>
<p>This is the first time ever I have not presented any presentation, this time it’s gonna be a pure talk where people can ask me anything about open source. I have started my talk with, what I am thinking or believing about open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-31-39.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1408" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-31-39.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a>For me, <em>contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and gain experience. No matter which skills you have, everything can be made useful. In this talk, I have shared the following points which can help you to get started with </em>an<em> open source contribution.</em><span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why contribute to open source?</em></li>
<li><em>What it means to contribute</em></li>
<li><em>Boost yourself to a new project; best example: Github</em></li>
<li><em>How to find a project to contribute to? : some sources Github, Your First PR, and so on.</em></li>
<li><em>How to submit a contribution?</em></li>
<li><em>What happens once you contributed?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I am always asking these questions to my self and trying to find out the answer, and guess what while finding the answer to these questions my contribution to open source automatically done.</p>
<p>A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. For me, contributions don’t have to be tech related as open source projects also need people who have non-tech skills, like documentation, localization, marketing, testing and much more.</p>
<p>For instance, <b><i>What can I do for Mozilla?</i></b> is a resource that helps pair people with the organization’s technical and non-technical needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Why do people contribute to open source? </i></b></p>
<p>To, improve existing skills<br />
To, meet people who are having similar interests<br />
To, find mentors and teach others<br />
To, build public artifacts that help to build your profile</p>
<p>Here are  few of my personal favorites Open Source Platforms;</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux &lt;3</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Python &amp; Rust</li>
<li>VLC Media Player &lt;3</li>
<li>Web Browsers:
<ul>
<li>Firefox &lt;3</li>
<li>Chromium (the basis for Chrome)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><i>I bet on you, within these kinds of projects exist more undetected bugs, probable improvements, and documentation deficiency. Therefore, even if you don’t want to learn how to code inside, still you can find ways to take part in the open source world.</i></p>
<p>There was a very healthy discussion between me and all the participants where they asking back to back questions and I am thus thoroughly enjoying to answer those questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-28-47.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-28-47.jpg?resize=720%2C720" width="720" /></a>Our goal via this talk is to make people understand that open source contribution have no explicit literal like hard-earned cash value. But, the implicit value, i.e. the opportunity to contribute to open source widely outweighs any literal cash value you might gain by giving your time over to a project. e.g. Guess how much money I got paid for contributing to Linux package? $0. Yep, it was $0.</p>
<p>Our aim is to people believe that if they don’t file bugs and make steps to reproduce them, or on ways to reproduce expected and unexpected behaviors, so coders/techs have no way of knowing how software gets used and what they should do get resolved.</p>
<p>At last, we also had round discussion of what participants thinking about open source and what their passion about open source.Everyone has shared their views and all an all it was great to hear their views on it.</p>

Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project. This is the way community builds with better engagement.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It has been a long time, I have been writing here. This blog post will be about sharing my personal experience during the Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration at Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, Telangana, India.</p>
<p>I have started contributing to Mozilla way back in 2012 and I am really elated that I have come a long way. All it started when a student from BITS contacted me on Facebook asking about the activities and opportunities that a student can be benefited. I told him about the Mozilla Campus Club Program to him and he got excited about it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, I explained him about Mozilla, its mission, vision, Campus Club Program, activities and how he can be a part of a global community. And then things went fast, we decided to inaugurate a Mozilla Campus Club in their college.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that we will be inaugurating a Mozilla Club on September 1st, 2017.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an amazing experience talking to students. I have talked on Mozilla, products, Mozilla Campus Club Program, Activate Mozilla Campaign, Rust, WebVR and Firefox Nightly Campaign. Looking forward to organizing more events in future.</p>
