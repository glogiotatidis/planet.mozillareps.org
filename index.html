                    <p>A Saturday well spent teaching students about Open Source, Add-ons and Privacy.</p>
<p>We had an activity at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)
for Addons, WoMoz and Privacy.</p>
<p>The session started with Trishul giving a talk on getting started with Add-ons.
He explained about Web Extensions and how they are useful. He also depicted some
of the extensions built by the community. He explained the use of <tt class="docutils literal">manifest</tt>
file and then students started making simple add-ons on their own. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension">borderify</a>
Web Extension was chosen to teach students. Me, Trishul and Shivam helped them
whenever they were stuck.</p>

<p>The next session was took by Faye on Women in Mozilla and how we can improve the
no of women contributors in the community.</p>

<p>The third session was took by me where I discussed about <cite>What is FOSS</cite> and why
people should contribute to FOSS. We then discussed on various pathways one can
start contributing. We also discussed on finding bugs through BugZilla and Bugsahoy
for Mozilla.</p>
<p>Then Shashikanth discussed about importance of Privacy issues.</p>
<p>We ended the event with a capture of all enthusiastic faces in the meetup:</p>

                  <h5>Moz-Fedora Day</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on January 14, 2018 02:45 PM</h6>
                    <p>We recently organized Moz-Fedora Day, a one day event on promoting FOSS through
Mozilla &amp; Fedora at Investopad, Hauz Khas, Delhi on Jan 13, 2018. The aim was
to depict the usage of packaging &amp; building one of the Mozilla's project using Fedora.</p>

<p>The core event focused on making the participants automate the build of any of
the Mozilla's open source project of their choice. The aim is to influence
people to switch to Linux as a build environment (We used Fedora for this)
and introduce the basics of the version control system (Mercurial in case of Mozilla).
The event will also introduce to Vagrant for running standardized virtual
machines for build environments.</p>

<p>The session began with Saurabh representing a bit about Fedora and other Linux
Distributions. I discussed about Mozilla, it's mission and different projects.
We then decided to package <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> in Fedora and guided
folks through the steps to build the system. We used simple Vagrant setup to
package Servo project with Fedora.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, we had a small discussion on how one can find bugs
through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy. The presentation can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/">http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/</a></p>
<p>We also distributed some swags to folks who were able to make builds successfully.</p>

<p>Most of this was a hands-on session and I saw new faces who were truly excited to
learn about these things. A Saturday well spent, spreading the love of Open Source.</p>

                  <h5>Mozilla.cz 2017 recap</h5>
                    <h6>Michal Stanke on January 14, 2018 12:00 AM</h6>
                    <p>This week I have published a <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/zpravicky/ohlednuti-za-rokem-2017/">recapitulation of the last year</a>, how we did in 2017 and how we would like to continue in 2018. It was rather a short article in Czech and I would like to elaborate more here for the global Mozilla community.</p>

<p>In the last year we have attended more conferences than I realized. I was surprised when counting them before writing the post, and if I counted right, the final number is eight, plus a secondary school. Btw. did you know we started meetups too? Yes, we did! We call them MozBeers and so far we had them in Prague and Brno, the two largest cities in the Czech Republic. True, our MozBeers are not happening regularly, but we have them. Also I need to highlight we never gathered in the full count on any place, nor meetups nor conferences, but thanks we were able to share our experience and ideas, everything went smooth.</p>

<p>Localization became our natural activity we do not even have to plan or organize much. We have localized both versions of Firefox Focus for Android and iOS (kudos to Michal Vašíček and the rest of the team), all the new Tet Pilot experiments, and Firefox Quantum of course! I don’t want to boast, but retrospectively I think we could do even twice as much l10n work without even noticing.</p>

<p>After such year I am pretty positive about our community traction. There are new faces around and I feel much less pressure on myself, which was not the case a year ago. Despite we still s**k in our communication in the direction outside, I see this improving in the last months. We have created a Telegram channel as an open channel to reach us in a completely informal way for all the Czech users and the broader community. Plus we have got <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/sumo/2018/01/13/the-big-sumo-report-2017/">Czech in the social support tool</a>. @firefox now speaks Czech too! I hope we can improve in the area of communication in 2018 even more.</p>

<p>There are several priority goals we are already decided to do in 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go through all the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&amp;namedcmd=Open%20[cs]%20bugs">terminology bugs and questions</a> we have filed on ourselves and resolve them.</li>
  <li>Write a localization style guide. This is a long overdue task.</li>
  <li>Finish all other, mostly technical <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/ukoly/">tasks</a> we have.</li>
  <li>Get Firefox.cz and Mozilla.cz in a new dress. No promises on this, but it seems to happen soonish.</li>
  <li>Build a strategy for regular and interesting content for Mozilla.cz. This will be a tough one.</li>
  <li>Show ourselves everywhere possible. ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>You already see there is plenty for us to do. I could barely complete a half of these tasks only myself, but I see them as a peace of cake being surrounded by the army of awesome Mozillians!</p>

                  <h5>Reps Council at Austin</h5>
                    <h6>kpapadea on January 11, 2018 01:41 PM</h6>
                    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><em>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco"> All Hands Wiki page</a> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about what 2018 planning. One of our main topics was about the Mission Driven Mozillians proposal.</em></p>
Hot Topics
<p>As you already know, we asked in the past for your input on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/your-input-on-open-questions-for-mission-driven-mozillians-project/22388/">discourse</a> (if you’re not already subscribed to the Reps category, maybe now it’s the right moment)</p>
<p>Before we start with the recap of the week, we would like to say thank you to the Reps that left feedbacks on that thread (Felipe, Edoardo and André) but also all to the Mozillians on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-volunteer-leadership-principles-practices/22386/</a> that left their feedbacks too.</p>
<p>These suggestions were very important and on shaping the document that will be available soon (we had more discussions during the All Hands so the new revised version is not yet ready).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.18.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Mission Driven Mozillians was the major topic on the Reps Council meetings. After consulting the results of Communities and Contributors Qualitative Survey we shaped the following questions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whJ6cyR-zozeMdEjtuvQTitSpz5T6bsy44AP0I7f6Y4/edit</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Reps program really a representative of all the mozillian communities?</li>
<li>How does the program need to evolve to engage more with our members?</li>
<li>How can we get new Reps to join the new Coach and Resources initiatives?</li>
<li>How can we improve the use of the report tool by our Reps?</li>
</ul>
Plans for 2018

<p> </p>
<p>Moving forward, our plan is to deep dive into those because and also start acting on them.</p>
<p>The council also highly engaged with the Leadership proposal (that had a high priority) since it will be the base on how Mozilla communities will be shaped in the near future and will of course influence our program.</p>
<p>Open by Design was the motto of this All Hands during all the meetings inside Open Innovation, but also across the organization. You see Mozilla has a strong value that the other IT companies don’t have: the community.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_525"><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/01/2018-01-11-14.35.24.jpg"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla is more than a Silicon Valley IT company</p></div>
<p>One of the most curious and interesting, for the purpose of openness, thing is the ability to access  official Mozilla Slack channels for all the mozillians with NDA to. This support enables the volunteers to be able to communicate directly with the employees. And Yes, as Reps you have already signed the NDA so you can access without problems the various channels!</p>

                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on December 24, 2017 03:04 PM</h6>
                    <p>We had <tt class="docutils literal">MozCoffee Delhi</tt> on last Saturday, Dec 23, 2017. We had a lot of Rep
Attendees this time with other Mozillians. What would have been a better way to
end an year than the MozCoffee. From past various months, the activities in
Mozilla Delhi came to a stand still. But then we had MozCoffee planned in less
than a week. Thanks to my new mentor Trishul for arranging MozCoffee at Chaayos,
Connaught Place, New Delhi on 23rd December, 2017.</p>
<p>We gathered up at the venue in the evening and met a lot of new and old people.
We had Trishul, Faye, Sanyam, Tanzeel, Dvyik, Rajiv, Saurabh, Pushpita, Shivam, Tushar at the meetup.</p>
<p>The discussion started with Trishul explaining about his experience in All Hands Austin.
He told about various projects that have been identified by Mozilla as the major
areas of contributions. We discussed about both tech &amp; non-tech contributions
in various areas.</p>
<p>Near the end of the event, Trishul also helped me in explaining about addons.
Since I've previous experience with JS, it was pretty easy to pick that stuff up.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some amazing photographs which would now become a memory for all of us.</p>

                  <h5>Retour sur le meetup-hackathon WebExtensions</h5>
                    <h6>Villeneuve Christophe on December 01, 2017 01:47 PM</h6>
                    <p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/soiree.jpg"></a> Les 17 et 18 novembre dernier, Mozilla Paris <a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/post/2017/11/meetup-Hackathon-webextensions-Mozilla-Paris" hreflang="fr" title="Meetup et hackathon WebExtensions chez Mozilla Paris (3 nov. 2017) Communauté Mozilla francophone">accueillait</a> un hackathon dédié aux WebExtensions. Ce nouveau modèle d’extensions multinavigateur était devenu exclusif dans Firefox quelques jours plus tôt. Une soirée de présentation a précédé la journée de programmation de ces extensions.</p>
<p>Pour préparer le hackathon, il fallait une soirée de lancement.</p>    <p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/conf-meetup.jpg" title="Salle conférence à Mozilla Paris"></a></p>

<p>Ce hackathon sous le signe du portage et de la migration des extensions a été introduit par deux présentations.</p>

<p>Tout d’abord, notre Mozillien Christophe Villeneuve a montré comment porter les extensions développées pour Chrome vers Firefox. Il a listé les erreurs couramment rencontrées lors de ces opérations. Vous pouvez retrouver ses diapos (<i lang="en">slides</i>) :</p>

<p>Ensuite, Marc de <a href="https://www.lilo.org/fr/" hreflang="fr" title="Lilo moteur de recherche">Lilo</a> a partagé son expérience dans le développement d’extensions pour un moteur de recherche « qui finance des projets sociaux et environnementaux ». Il a justifié ses choix techniques face aux  contraintes de son service et des navigateurs pris en charge.</p>

<p>Enfin, il a été temps pour les participants de proposer leurs envies, manques, besoin aux <i lang="en">hackers</i> du lendemain.</p>

<p><br />
<em style="display: block; text-align: center;">Extrait des idées des participants</em></p>

<p>Après une courte nuit, les participants sont revenus avec beaucoup d’idées suite aux différentes conversations de la veille.</p>

<p>Au cours de la journée, les développements ont été très variés, avec une pause en milieu de journée pour reprendre des forces. Voici une petite liste des projets en cours établie en fin de journée :</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/mozfr/evenements/meetup/midi.jpg"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Tamper proxy (anciennement Tamper Data) : monitoring de requête</li>
<li>Top Word  : un outil pour analyser le nombre de mots employés dans une page et les classer</li>
<li>Aria Liner : une extension d’accessibilité</li>
<li>Un cloneur de contenu</li>
<li>Une extension pour communiquer avec le site liveslide.io</li>
<li>DevTools PHP : un débogueur PHP dans la console</li>

<p>Ce fut l’occasion pour les participants d’apprendre à créer les extensions. Ils vont continuer le développement pour pouvoir les mettre prochainement dans le <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/" hreflang="fr" title="Site des extensions de Firefox">dépôt site des extensions</a> de Mozilla.</p>

<p>Nous sommes sûrs que certains projets verront le jour très rapidement.</p>

<p>En outre, les idées proposées et non retenues ne sont pas perdues. Elles ont été envoyées sur le <a href="https://github.com/firefox-addons/ideas/issues" hreflang="en" title="dépôt communautaire des extensions">dépôt communautaire</a>. La communauté des extensions pourra s’en inspirer pour en réaliser une.</p>

<p>Après ce marathon, les organisateurs ont reçu des demandes pour refaire un événement de ce type. Ils ont été sensibles à cette forte demande… Ce sera pour 2018. Alors, à suivre…</p>

                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on November 30, 2017 02:12 PM</h6>
                    <p>Event was the follow-up of <a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/">MozAarambh</a> . Students were very much excited to know about the Virtual reality  in our previous event. So we went again with A-frame and WebVR through WebVR Camp.</p>

<p>Event started with a warm welcome and introduction of WebVR. We have distributed Aframe postcards , thanks for the wonderful cheatsheet, to all the attendees so that they get to know about Aframe and WebVR in detail and how to get involved in it. With the brief walkthrough of agenda we went to the Computer Lab where the actual fun begun.</p>

<p>We started with the hello world example of A-frame, later everyone was able to mix and make their own hello world .</p>

<p>All the projects developed during this event need few finishing after that we’ll be hosting them to a central repository. We are happy to see great ethusiasm among the students of Jharkhand Rai University, got to know more about the problems they had earlier too, I hope I’ll be able to fix few of them and with the support of the community we’ll make this Jharkhand community a productive one.</p>

                  <h5>Pontoon Tools 3.0</h5>
                    <h6>Michal Stanke on November 12, 2017 12:00 AM</h6>
                    <p>After 150 commits in total, Pontoon Tools got a third major release 3.0! From now on, post-installation/update tour will show you the most important features in Pontoon Tools. So this time for the last time probably (and shortly) what’s new in the new and still shiny Pontoon Tools 3.0.</p>

<p>As noted, there is a new introduction tour listing all major features of Pontoon Tools. It will appear after first installation or major version update. You can guess where I took inspiration for its design. Please check it carefully, as there may be feature you were not aware of before. ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://michal.stanke.cz/assets/img/pontoon-tools-intro.jpg" style="display: block; text-align: center;"></a></p>

<p>Also a completely new feature arrived, which are system notifications. Pontoon Tools can now utilize the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Notifications">notifications API</a> to inform you about new unread notifications in Pontoon. Because I understand not everyone must be happy with something popping up in the system, this feature is disabled by default and the introduction tour will allow you to enable it quickly.</p>

<p>And last but not least, I have unified the toolbar button popup style with Pontoon itself, and added short information about last team activity. The complete list of all the small improvements, including those on background, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/releases/tag/v3.0">release notes</a>. If you are not using Pontoon Tools yet, your can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pontoon-tools/">install them into your Firefox from AMO</a>.</p>

                  <h5>My Experience - Mozfest17</h5>
                    <h6> on November 09, 2017 09:52 AM</h6>
                    



<p>Right now, I’m
on my flight back from London where I had the pleasure to assist to the Mozilla
Festival 2017. I’ll try to use this 2 hours of my flight time to relate to you
how my experience was before and during it as well as the things that really
impressed me of it.</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to the first beginning of the
Festival, Friday 27 at 5:00 a.m. On that time, I was just waking up after
getting only a few hours of sleep because of all the excitement I was having
for the festival, so I got dressed up as a zombie and after a really fast
breakfast that consisted on the remaining cookies of the pantry and a really
hot coffee that seemed like magma, I headed towards the airport. There, some
boring and long queues where waiting for me, as well as, the not well-received
security checkpoint where I had to take from my bag all the electronic things I
had on it (More than half of a dozen, I think the security guy got crazy when
he saw it). Finally, I made it into the plane and I headed towards London.</p>

<p>Once there, I
used all the time I had until the festival to do some sightseeing in London and
visit the typical places you usually go as a Tourist like the Big Ben, the
London Eye or the Queen’s Castle (With the famous queen’s guards on it). Also,
I tried the so famous “Fish and Chips”.</p>

<p>After all of
this, it arrived the time, the time to go the Mozilla Festival in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p><b><i>A few
minutes later</i></b></p>

<p>I saw the Ravensbourne building after a few
minutes going around, so big, so squarish, full of strange circles on it… I
went inside and I proceeded with the Check-In process where I got my Lanyard
and I went inside of it.  The first day
it was a Networking event, I didn’t really get involved with it because it was
my first Networking event ever and I felt like a fish out of water. Eventually
I got the essence of it and I started meeting some great people there like
Florian, Konstantina, Ayah, as well as, my mentor Michael.  After it, we had dinner in a nearby restaurant
and I headed back towards the hostel.
First day was over…</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up, 7 a.m. After
some improvised breakfast in the hostel, I went to Ravensbourne, today it was
the day to start with the sessions. I went to sessions about confidence, others
about Privacy and also, I attended a really interesting talk about
Matrix.org.  The lunch time was also kind
of Networking so I tried to engage in different conversations with people
around me, amazing time.</p>

<p>At night, Mozilla organized a party on the
Royal Society of Arts (RSA) where there was some electronic music by a guy
dressed like Tron, with really futuristic design and music. There was also some
comedy on the Auditory, it was a great night but I headed back sooner than I
expected because I felt really tired of all day sessions.</p>

<p>Third and Last day… We started the day with
a Networking Breakfast in Ravensbourne sponsored by Flattr (You should check
them out, they have great ideas). After it, I decided to go around and try the
different stuff available on it instead of going to more sessions. There, I had
the pleasure to try a great VR game about some experiments that took place in
the military, also, I got to know about The Data Detox Bar and a bunch of other
great stuff there to.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time to go, so I had to say
bye to all the people I met during the festival day and I headed to the train
(Funny story here, due to the time change, the app became crazy and it changed
my whole schedule. I decided to trust my gut and I followed my prescheduled
journey hoping to don’t lose the flight. It worked and after some crazy runs up
and down the London Bridge station, I made it into the train and I headed
towards the Airport. It was time to go back home.</p>

                  <h5>Resources Reps, what’s next?</h5>
                    <h6>Rizki Kelimutu on November 01, 2017 04:52 PM</h6>
                    <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/christosbacharakis/24555180461" title="IMG_8366.CR2"></a></p>
<p>In the previous <a href="https://kelimuttu.github.io/rep-resources-training/">blog post</a>, I wrote about the learnings that we got from the initial training session. And last Friday, we just <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/resources-track-applications-are-now-open/18367/12?u=rizki_kelimutu">announced</a> the new graduates from the final phase of Resources Rep training. The assessment was made during the 3 weeks of the training (whether group or individual exercises) that started on the 2nd of October until 21st of October 2017. You can also see the full list of the Rep Resources graduates in the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">Reps portal</a>. But I would like to quickly take you back on the initial purpose of Resources Reps.</p>
<p><b>What is a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>The idea behind the Resources Reps  is to have specialized Reps who are trained to help communities and other fellow Reps to plan strategically how they use the resources that the Reps program offers. This will ensures that resources of the program are used in the most impactful way and according to the<a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/budget-allocation-q1-2/14650"> guidance</a> provided by Mozilla’s strategy and the Council.</p>
<p><b>When did the training happened?</b></p>
<p>The training sessions happened in 3 phases. The first one, which was the trial training, happened during 24th of July – 12th of August 2017. We asked  6 Reps to participate on this trial session to help us improve the training. After the trial training, we then opened the application for the rest of the Reps and decided to carry on with the first phase of the training with the India applicants during 11th of September – 1st of October. Finally, the last phase happened on the 2nd of October – 21st of October.</p>
<p>During the 3 weeks of the training, the candidates were asked to go through the training material and complete the quiz every  week. And in the end of each week (we decided to have the meeting on the weekend), we scheduled a video meeting for an hour in order to have work and discuss on the subject together.</p>
<p><b>What did we learn from the overall training?</b></p>
<p>On the trial training, the participants helped  a lot in terms of improving the content of the training. Thanks to them, now we have the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Budget/Receipts_guide">receipt guideline</a> to help the Rep identify which receipts are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>On the first phase of the training with Reps from India, we were experimenting with a new video conference tool, which surprisingly performed so much better than the tool that we usually use.</p>
<p>And on the second phase, I learned a lot about accessibility issues. Since we need to accommodate so many time zones, I decided to break the meeting into 2 sessions in each weekend. The first session is for the Asia, Europe, and Africa, and the other session is for the Pacific people who lived in North or South America.</p>
<p>The first meeting was rather challenging since we had people with problems on communication (more specifically a deaf participant and a person that was not able to follow up in English). This came to me as a shock, because that was something I was not prepared for. But fortunately, with some love of the local community, we were able to have an effective meeting. It’s super amazing to see how people were willing to help each other in the training. It was also a reminder for me to think about accessibility in advance for our future activities. For example like providing dial in details for a meeting could be so much beneficial for some people who don’t have access to a PC and can only join via phone. Or checking on the participants before the meeting in case there’s somebody who need special support. Because if we want to excel on diversity and inclusion, then we need to take further action to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p><b>How can I apply to be a Resources Rep?</b></p>
<p>For now we’re in the process of evaluating our current graduates. So in the meantime, we are not accepting more applications. But there’s a possibility we will reopen the application in the future. We’ll let you know for sure.</p>
<p><b>What’s next?</b></p>
<p>New Reps that  don’t have access to the budget and swag, can now ask for help from these <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Resources">Resources Rep</a>. We will no longer need to assign the bug to the mentor if the request was made by a Resources Rep. And instead it will go directly to the review team. And ideally, the new Reps should choose Resources Rep who’s close to their region. So, for example if I’m a new Rep from the US, I will ask for help from <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/hashrocket/">Jason</a> who in this case is the Resources Rep who live the closest to me. You can also see the group on the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/#/group/resources/">reps portal</a>.</p>
<p>We’re also going to reshuffle the Review Team members in the near future. The Review Team is now discussing the recommendation list from the current Resources Rep to be sent to the council for the future candidates of the Review team. We’ll keep you updated for the process.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank the participants of the Resources Rep training. And especially for those who always make the time on their weekend to join the meeting in each week. Congratulations!</p>

                  <h5>The story of me@mozilla</h5>
                    <h6>Michal Stanke on October 20, 2017 12:00 AM</h6>
                    <p>After our successful presence on the <a href="https://www.linuxdays.cz/2017/">LinuxDays</a> conference in Prague, I have been asked by a <a href="https://www.linuxexpres.cz/">Linux Expres</a> for an interview, how I get to the Mozilla community, what I do there, etc. <del>The article is not public yet</del> The article went out <a href="https://www.linuxexpres.cz/rozhovor/michal-stanke-ceska-komunita-by-mohla-prosazovat-mobilni">today</a>, but I have realized I never told this story to the Mozilla community itself. So take some popcorn and make yourself comfortable…</p>

<p>Back in times when I thought PowerPoint presentations are the masterpiece of computer science and their quality score is determined by the number of animations per slide, my Internet Explorer got sick. After an attempt to change the homepage in hope it will stop showing me ads everywhere, I have decided I need a new browser. I knew some people online and asked them for a recommendation, and their answers were Opera and Firefox. I never saw any of them in action before, so I dived into the dark unknown waters of the internet to download them for testing. My first impression from Opera was it’s too complex and complicated to change the homepage and import bookmarks, while Firefox did that all for me when I clicked all the <em>Next &gt;</em> buttons. The winner was clear.</p>

<p>That was <strong>Firefox 2.0</strong>, way different from Internet Explorer. When exploring the user documentation to help me a bit, I found an information, that 3.0 is imminent. Wow, a browser that is being developed and will have a new <em>version</em>. Super cool for someone using the old IE! But the documentation did not helped me much actually, which drove me right into the registration form of the <strong>Czech community forum</strong>, and here my community story begins.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized that I know answers for other questions on the forum, so I started answering. About the same time I have decided to start using all Mozilla-based applications I can make use of, namely Thunderbird and Instantbird (which I <strong>started localizing</strong> soon). Later the Mozilla.cz team offered me to translate some <strong>articles on SUMO</strong> and websites like AMO, but for me the Czech community forum was still the top until 2014, when Pavel Cvrček (JasnaPaka) offered me to <strong>translate Thunderbird</strong> on my own. That was huge responsibility for me, but also recognition. I thought that’s the most you can achieve, I felt like a real boss.</p>

<p>The next year, 2015, was like a big spinning wheel, outlined by the <strong>Mozilla.cz restart</strong> initiative led by Pavel to rebuild the Mozilla.cz website content (and design) and utilize as much of Mozilla infrastructure as we can. The motto was “Mozilla is doing many things, and they do them right”, it’s not necessary to update own versions of user documentation anymore. The second half of the year was very turbulent. Pavel decided to forward me the responsibility for <strong>Mozilla.cz content</strong> and <strong>Firefox localization</strong>, leaving the community projects due to the lack of time. At the end of the year, the changes in the community probably became so visible, that I have been invited to <strong>Mozlando</strong>, to meet my first non-Czech Mozillians in person.</p>

<p>The last two years I will sum in a sentence or two. I try to act like a community peer for every l10n and support related project in Mozilla, I became a Rep, and after our localization community grew over 4 people, I am unable to name all the milestones we have outlined and achieved. The last two years are not really a story of me@mozilla, but a story of <strong>czech-community@mozilla</strong>.</p>

<p>Now you may think that my involvement with the global Mozilla community is pretty short. And you are right. I am around the global stuff since 2014/15, still having longer experience with support forums answers than anything else. But for me that illustrates how powerful and dynamic the Mozilla community is.</p>

                  <h5>My Story with Mozilla</h5>
                    <h6> on October 18, 2017 08:11 PM</h6>
                    <p>I was in high school,
sitting in the Computers room, taking part of a boring and monotonous class
about Office IT. Because of that, I decided to open Firefox and start surfing
the web for some entertainment to make the time passed faster. So, I clicked in
the Firefox logo, Firefox popped-up and as soon as it opened, I realized about of
a yellow square at the bottom of Firefox asking me to took part of Mozilla and
become a volunteer. </p>



<p>In that moment, I
was dubitative because I didn’t really know what to do or if it was worth it
but I recalled a conversation I had with my best friend at that time about
Mozilla and its principles and decided to give it a try… I pressed the yellow
squared button and it redirected me into a webpage that showed me all the activities
I could join  (Labs, Localization,
Coding, Marketing, QA…).   After a few minutes, I decided that I wanted
to help with QA, testing some products as Firefox Beta, Firefox Nightly or the now
ceased Firefox Aurora because I wanted to make Firefox a better browser with
less bugs and more stability. </p>



<p>Once I clicked
it, it opened my email prompting me to write an E-Mail to the responsible of QA
Area in Mozilla Hispano (who I would know later as Gabriela) stating that I
wanted to contribute in that area and the reasons for it.  I wrote the email and she quickly answered it giving
me some tasks to do in Teambox (A site we used in order to organize tasks and
activities) as well as giving me some mentorship so I could start helping as
fast as possible. </p>

<p> Time passed really
quick and I went from being a newcomer to be part as a member of Mozilla without
with no more mentorship. Anyway, I kept in touch with Gabriela because she was my
friend and still the responsible of the area. As time passed by, I saw a drop
in the participation of the QA area so I proposed Gabriela a new scheme for it.
She really liked the idea and she decided to offer me the possibility of being
co-responsible of the area so I could help her with all the task involved which
I clearly accepted.  

</p><p> A year passed
without a lot of changes, I routinely participated in the friday testdays about
Firefox Beta, we also organized an amazing Spanish testday which was
well-received and well-appreciated for the Hispanic contributors of Mozilla and
I tried to help in other areas like Marketing or Localization.

</p><p> One day, I saw a
notification about a QA/Localization hackathon that would take part in Paris somewhere
near November 2015. The idea of going to Paris to the Mozilla Office really
fascinated me and I applied as fast as I could, wishing to be selected for it
so I could have the opportunity to meet other people as passionate as I for
Mozilla. Somehow, my wishes became true and I got the chance to travel to Paris
and meet some contributors there like Facyber (My great friend Marko) or
Marcia, a nice woman from Mozilla which I only had the pleasure to talk by iRC
and the one who taught us all she could about FirefoxOS in the short time of
two days. It was a really great experience.

</p><p>Sadly, one day,
Mozilla decided to cut off Firefox OS, and that decision took with it some ups
and downs which made some contributors leave the community because they didn’t
see a clear orientation or a clear focus and all the communities of Mozilla around
the world saw a big break on its activities. In that moment, I was really busy
studying for the exams of the university and other stuff so I became really inactive
for a few months and I did not really see what was coming. </p>



<p>Once I returned,
I realized how everything was stopped and I felt really guilty for it. For that
reason, some contributors and I decided that it was time to relaunch the
community and we got down to work for it. At first, we took some surveys and we
decided some goals for the community but this approach didn’t clearly work out,
so some months later, we decided to take it back and we proposed some interesting
new projects to work on and as of today, it seems it has worked because we got
new projects and new contributors working on them. </p>



<p>To conclude, I
have to add that after relaunching the community, I got really motivated so I
decided that it was time to step up and apply to become a Mozilla Rep as other
people recommended me.</p>

                  <h5>MozAarambh Jharkhand RAI University</h5>
                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on October 17, 2017 03:52 PM</h6>
                    <p>I started my journey in Mozilla as a contributor to Mozilla Community Rajasthan and met many enthusiasts who inspired me to do  every possible contributions i could do to Mozilla and Open source in general. I am from Jharkhand , after returning from Rajasthan, I met a mozillian from Jharkhand community, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/amitsin6h/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amit Singh</a> , he is very passionate about learning new things and very much like the idea of working in open.</p>
<p>I got to know many problems of the people wanted to contribute. Major problem is the availability of support from Mozilla and Mozilla Reps in general. There are many Reps from this region , but unfortunatly they are working outside this state. They are very helpful in arranging things, but… But they want their presence, they want to hear them in person and want to know their success story, how they came to mozilla and why….. There are many more questions asked by few contributors who wanted to continue the same. I listed their questions and figured out many possible things we could do together to improve the contributions from this region.</p>
<p>I moved to Ranchi officially , it was the time when i was very busy with my work. A phone call rang, it was Amit , wanted to know if i can organize an event in Jharkhand Rai University. I said yes, definitely . He introduced me to Prof. Shudhanshu, after meeting him we fixed the date, 6th Oct. 2017. Made a poster , promoted in Jharkahnd Rai University.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Event day, we reached the venue on time, we received a warm welcome. Prof. Shudhanshu introduced us infornt of students. I see a hall, full pacekd with students almost 200+ . I introduced myself  and why I choose to contribute to Mozilla and Open source. Students were listening this as if they were sitting in a lecture room. It was the tme to bring out few swags , in a minute everyone was answering questions, asking interesting questions. <strong>Swag has some power!!!!!</strong></p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/mozaarambh-jharkhand-rai-university/photo62827609851943751521/"></a>

<p>I started with introduction of Mozilla, Firefox and Open Source. To my surprise everyone knows about these things. Then I got to know that they had one introduction event of mozilla but after that never heard back from that mozillian. Then I introduced them about the mozilla’s products and projects, what actually matters. People were very excited to know about WebVR, Rust and WebCompat .</p>

<p>I forgot to introduce the speakers, I had Amit and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Malam1212/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mahtab</a> with me who was sharing the stage. Amit gave session on WebCompat and even showed a demo on how to file a report. Mahtab gave session on L10n and how a non-coder students still contribute to open source.</p>

<p>Event concluded with a group picture. A mozilla style of conclusion!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Actual thing happend after the event , there were 80 students who wanted to know the possibilities and ways to involve with Mozilla and it’s projects. We get back to the hall ,selected few students who have shown their interest in making a club. I introduced Mozilla Campus Club to them. We formed a team and created Telegram groups so that we stay in loop.</p>

<p>Mozilla Jharkhand has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozilla.jharkhand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">facebook group</a> and after the event people joined this group in hige number, from 170 we reached to 246 in a single day. Not only they joined in this group, they have introduced themself to this group, which i never seen in other community as this scale. This shows they are very active and only need a correct Mentor to guide them.</p>
<p>I will love to do the role of Mentor to them. And next day we were rocking on local newspaper. Planning a series of events in this college to educate them and make a good contributor.</p>

                    <p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">The event is focused on introducing and teaching the state of art system programming language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust</a> to local programmers and Mozillians in Gujarat.  This is the first time <strong>Mozilla</strong> will participate at <strong>ORDINATEUR’17</strong>! The summit will involve students and tech enthusiasts from the university. I gave a talk on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust programming</a> which is one of emerging technologies and one of the major focus of Mozilla.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>About ORDINATEUR’17 :</strong></p>
<p>ORDINATEUR’17 is a one of a kind flagship event organized by IEEE GCET Computer Society Student Chapter under the them “<strong><em>Tech Trend &amp; Innovate</em></strong>”</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/poster.jpg"></a>Before, I shared my experience with this talk, so let me tell you one thing that this was my one of the best intellectual programming debate talk. Yes, it is! <span id="more-1416"></span></p>
<p>I have started with Introduction to Mozilla and “Who am I”. Adding to that, I have also shared about Mozilla projects and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust </a>is one of them. So now, Lets Dive Into Rust!</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8975.jpg"></a><br />
According to me, <em>Rust is a good choice when you’d choose C++. You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why should I use Rust? </strong></em>I am always expecting this question whenever I talk about Rust and here as well one language enthusiast asked me the same questions.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, I have shared the reason that I’ve looked into Rust at first and then I have explained and discussed each point with participants.  </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_04-10-17.jpg"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages</li>
<li>It is low-level enough that you take account of most resources.</li>
<li>It’s more like C++ and Go, less like Node and Ruby</li>
<li>cargo is awesome. Managing crates just works as intended, which makes a whole lot of troubles you may have in other languages just vanish with a satisfying <em>poof</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_8938.jpg"></a>It was always fun to play with Rust and glad that participants also enjoyed while rusty their hand.</p>

                  <h5>Why Open Source ?</h5>
                    <h6>Mehul Patel on September 23, 2017 10:25 PM</h6>
                    <p>Firstly, let me extend the thanks to <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">Yuvalay Electronics Lab</a> for inviting me as Speaker to give a talk on Open Source. Moreover, kudos to you to arrange a talk on Open source first time ever in <span class="_Xbe">Vadodara</span> city.</p>
<p><strong>About Yuvalay Electronics Lab</strong></p>
<p>Yuvalay Electronics Lab offers a platform and eco-system to the students, hobbyists, and professionals to understand and apply the theoretical knowledge of the subjects in the field of Electronics. It helps to convert the interest into the passion by providing a conducive environment to learn-explore-innovate under the guidance of experts. <a href="http://elab.yuvalay.org/" rel="noopener">More</a></p>
<p>This is the first time ever I have not presented any presentation, this time it’s gonna be a pure talk where people can ask me anything about open source. I have started my talk with, what I am thinking or believing about open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-31-39.jpg"></a>For me, <em>contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and gain experience. No matter which skills you have, everything can be made useful. In this talk, I have shared the following points which can help you to get started with </em>an<em> open source contribution.</em><span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why contribute to open source?</em></li>
<li><em>What it means to contribute</em></li>
<li><em>Boost yourself to a new project; best example: Github</em></li>
<li><em>How to find a project to contribute to? : some sources Github, Your First PR, and so on.</em></li>
<li><em>How to submit a contribution?</em></li>
<li><em>What happens once you contributed?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I am always asking these questions to my self and trying to find out the answer, and guess what while finding the answer to these questions my contribution to open source automatically done.</p>
<p>A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. For me, contributions don’t have to be tech related as open source projects also need people who have non-tech skills, like documentation, localization, marketing, testing and much more.</p>
<p>For instance, <b><i>What can I do for Mozilla?</i></b> is a resource that helps pair people with the organization’s technical and non-technical needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Why do people contribute to open source? </i></b></p>
<p>To, improve existing skills<br />
To, meet people who are having similar interests<br />
To, find mentors and teach others<br />
To, build public artifacts that help to build your profile</p>
<p>Here are  few of my personal favorites Open Source Platforms;</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux &lt;3</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Python &amp; Rust</li>
<li>VLC Media Player &lt;3</li>
<li>Web Browsers:
<ul>
<li>Firefox &lt;3</li>
<li>Chromium (the basis for Chrome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I bet on you, within these kinds of projects exist more undetected bugs, probable improvements, and documentation deficiency. Therefore, even if you don’t want to learn how to code inside, still you can find ways to take part in the open source world.</i></p>
<p>There was a very healthy discussion between me and all the participants where they asking back to back questions and I am thus thoroughly enjoying to answer those questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-28-47.jpg"></a>Our goal via this talk is to make people understand that open source contribution have no explicit literal like hard-earned cash value. But, the implicit value, i.e. the opportunity to contribute to open source widely outweighs any literal cash value you might gain by giving your time over to a project. e.g. Guess how much money I got paid for contributing to Linux package? $0. Yep, it was $0.</p>
<p>Our aim is to people believe that if they don’t file bugs and make steps to reproduce them, or on ways to reproduce expected and unexpected behaviors, so coders/techs have no way of knowing how software gets used and what they should do get resolved.</p>
<p>At last, we also had round discussion of what participants thinking about open source and what their passion about open source.Everyone has shared their views and all an all it was great to hear their views on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photo_2017-09-24_03-42-46.jpg"></a>Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project. This is the way community builds with better engagement.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG-9744.jpg"></a><br />
Thank you, everyone, who joined our talk!  Hope you enjoyed reading my blog.  </p>

                  <h5>Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration @ BITS,Warangal</h5>
                    <h6>Ajay Kumar Jogawath on September 11, 2017 06:07 AM</h6>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It has been a long time, I have been writing here. This blog post will be about sharing my personal experience during the Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration at Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, Telangana, India.</p>
<p>I have started contributing to Mozilla way back in 2012 and I am really elated that I have come a long way. All it started when a student from BITS contacted me on Facebook asking about the activities and opportunities that a student can be benefited. I told him about the Mozilla Campus Club Program to him and he got excited about it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, I explained him about Mozilla, its mission, vision, Campus Club Program, activities and how he can be a part of a global community. And then things went fast, we decided to inaugurate a Mozilla Campus Club in their college.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that we will be inaugurating a Mozilla Club on September 1st, 2017.</p>

                  <h5>Mozilla Latest Version - my first project dedicated to Mozilla</h5>
                    <h6>Michal Stanke on September 07, 2017 12:00 AM</h6>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaCZ/mozilla-latest-version">Mozilla Latest Version</a> (shortly <em>Mozlv</em>) was my first project I have written entirely because of Mozilla. It’s a WordPress plugin to get the latest version number of Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey and the corresponding links for download or release notes. Currently it loads data from ship-it (<a href="https://product-details.mozilla.org/">product-details.mozilla.org</a>), but it existed even before ship-it started to export this data to public. And at this moment, I am giving <em>Mozlv</em> some love again. ;)</p>

<p>It all started at the beginning of 2015, few months after Pavel Cvrček (JasnaPaka) outlined and kicked off the so called “Mozilla.cz restart”. We have reviewed all the content on the Mozilla.cz website (OK, it was mainly done by Pavel), reduced it and redirected outdated pages to SUMO articles and other appropriate sites, that were update regularly. We have also replaced the old <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/zpravicky/plnime-slib-a-tak-je-tu-novy-web-mozilla-cz/">Mozilla Europe like looking theme</a> for customized One Mozilla design. But despite making the whole website look new and shiny, we were still left with one big problem under the hood. The problem was in new Firefox versions being release every ~6 weeks. Each time a new version of Firefox or Thunderbird had been released, we needed to put it into WordPress. Of course, we had some plugin to update all the download links and version numbers across all pages, but we needed to watch the new releases on our own and paste them into the fields in administration.</p>

<p>Luckily we have realized soon there are several JSON files on mozilla.org and svn.mozilla.org containing exactly the information we needed. March 2015 was the month when <em>Mozlv</em> was born. It took me actually many hours, because PHP was my greatest enemy back then. :D After I have finished the plugin, there were no earth-shaking changes there. Yes, Firefox for Android and iOS were added, yes, ship-it replaced files placed on the svn server, but there were no bigger features, not even needed. Most of my commits were about fixing breakages.</p>

<p>About a week ago, you may have noticed, that I have added few commits and released version 2.0. “Oh, new major version! There must be plenty of new stuff there, right?” No, there is not, but I have been pretty lazy in bumping the versions in the past, deploying individual commits to Mozilla.cz. Making 2.0 sounds appropriate to me when there is a version actually working after so long. And this time <em>Mozlv</em> will hopefully serve another “community restart” - Mozilla.sk. In Czech Republic we see Slovakia like our brothers. I am helping for some time to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639192">revise the content</a> and soon we want to pick a new Mozilla theme too. But there will be one more thing… you are right… updates of Firefox download links. The difference from Mozilla.cz is, that on Mozilla.sk we want to not just switch to <em>Mozlv</em>, but also display an archive of previous Firefox releases. That’s something not implemented in the plugin and I hope to find some time to do it this autumn. And as a bonus, I have discovered there is an AMO JSON API, that would allow us to display information about features extensions from AMO too!</p>

<p><em>Mozlv</em> is my first project and after more than two years, I am surprised the code is still used somewhere, even more it seems to get extended by two quite big features soon and be deployed to a new website. If you run a community website on WordPress and deal with updating Firefox versions manually, try Mozilla Latest Version. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/MozillaCZ/mozilla-latest-version/">GitHub</a> and if you encounter any issues with deployment, feel free to get in touch.</p>

                    SHA, aka Still Hacking Anyways, is part of international non profit outdoor hacker camp series organized once in 4 years in The Netherlands. This year it was organized in Zeewolde on August 4th to 8th and I was honored to be one of speakers at SHA for my WebVR talk.

                  <h5>MozConnect with IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit</h5>
                    <h6>Mehul Patel on August 22, 2017 05:18 PM</h6>
                    <p>While wrapping up with <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/rain-of-rust-how-we-did-it/">RainOfRust</a> campaigns I was working on reports and gathering feedbacks from the community about our recent initiative and we got an overwhelmed responses from the all around. The participation with IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit was one of the feedback of our recent work for the community.</p>
<p>Here IEEE Gujarat Section and IEEE GCET Student Branch invited me to join at IEEE R10 Sectional Leadership Summit which was organized on 3rd &amp; 4th August at G H Patel College of Engineering &amp; Technology, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat.</p>
<p>I was very excited and I accepted their invitation as this was the 1st time Mozilla’s presence at IEEE summit.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_2666.jpg"></a><span id="more-1374"></span></p>
<p><strong>About the summit:</strong></p>
<p>The Leadership Summit aims to convene student members of the IEEE to enable them to discuss the growth and development of IEEE student activities in societies, not only within the Section but also in Region 10 (Asia- Pacific) as a whole.</p>
<p>The theme of the summit <strong>was Innovation and Empowerment.</strong></p>
<p>The students will be from all levels of UG and PG programs will be benefitting from the summit. The given theme will encourage and motivate the students on how can they have a way to innovation. There will be discussions and parallel sessions, conducted by Industrialists and professionals, which will focus on the recent trends and upcoming technologies.</p>
<p>This event has definitely uplifted the Section as a whole and created a benchmark for other events taking place across India as well</p>
<p>This was my first visit to this City and university so I was really excited to talk with participants and experts who came to attend this summit.</p>
<p>My session was second last and here I started addressing the audience by sharing about Mozilla and its mission before I moved on to my actual talk i.e. <strong>Open Innovation</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/open.jpg"></a>Here we have discussed <em><strong>How open is it for everyone?</strong></em> Many students shared their thoughts during the talk and it was great to hear their thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Open”</strong> means that anyone can publish or invent online without asking for permission, and that the technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then after I have talked about the Open Innovation Toolkit, <em>The Open Innovation Toolkit is a community sourced set of best practices and principles to help you incorporate human-centered design into your product development process. Whether you have a new idea or a working prototype to test, the Open Innovation Toolkit can help.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_4186.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Mozilla Innovation team have designed best 3 methods,</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Gather Insights</li>
<li>Ideate</li>
<li>Prototype&amp; Test</li>
</ol>
<p>More details, <a href="https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to limited time, I go ahead with <strong>“Ideate</strong>” method to discuss more by running 2 activities among participants.</p>
<p><strong>1st Activity :</strong></p>
<b>5 “Whys”</b>
<blockquote><p>Purpose of this activity to get to the root cause of the problem with the goal of thinking differently and as a result you will analyse the root cause which is great at making sure you are solving the right problem at first.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/photo_2017-08-22_22-26-21.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>2nd Activity :</strong></p>
<strong>Mind map</strong>
<p><em>A Mind Map is a powerful graphic technique which provides a universal key to unlock the potential of the brain.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>This activity helps when you are facing complex problem. They are organic in their structure and allows us to, via a visual representation, explain how a system or concept is complement each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just to understand better we have run this activity with all the participants present there, I have already informed organizing team to put some bank papers and pen to participants kit.</p>
<p>I have explained to them how this works and what they need to follow to be part of this activity: so here are the steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Start in the center of your page with the subject you want to mind map around. For example “Security”</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Break down the main concept into the areas it relates to. Like “Cyber Security”, “tracking”, gadgets”, “tools”, “threats” “precautions” etc.</p>
<p>3. Further, continue branching those streams out and thinking about what is related until your entire paper is filled out.</p>
<p>4. The end result should be having complete overview of the branches of ideas or concepts that came from your starting point.</p>
<p>At the end of this activity, some students shared an overview of the branches of their ideas and that was an amazing experience.</p>

                  <h5>It’s raining Rust at Red Hat</h5>
                    <h6>Abhiram on August 20, 2017 02:21 PM</h6>
                    <p>I know it’s been a while since I’ve put out a post and mostly because I’m trying to learn amazing things and get my hands dirty, trying to build solutions that actually make sense.</p>
<p>One such pet-project has been Rust, probably the <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/06/08/language-rankings-6-17/">fastest</a> growing systems level programming language today. Hitherto, I’ve always looked at Rust from the outside, never got my hands dirty, mostly because I was under the assumption that it had nothing to do with web development. Turns out, I was completely wrong!</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/rainofrust-campaign-trailer/15852">Rain of Rust</a> campaign gave me an opportunity to revisit the programming language and the reason why it’s been garnering interests at astronomical pace. For a nascent programming language which is in the 1.19th version of its release, it’s challenging the big guns – C and C++. Yes, you heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why">it </a>right.</p>
On to the campaign
<p>The campaign, although initiated and led by volunteers from the Mozilla India community at first was later adopted by the larger Mozilla community with contributions from all over the world like these events in <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-activate/">Mexico </a>and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/dive-into-rust-senai-santa-cecilia/">Brazil</a>. The main goal of the event was to increase outreach about the language and train developers to contribute in the rust ecosystem.</p>
At Bangalore
<p>As one of the crucial aspects of the campaign was to organize on-the-ground events and so, with the gracious support of our host Sumantro at Red Hat, we managed to pull of a small event consisting of rust enthusiasts and Mozilla Tech Speakers.</p>
<p>We had our very own Vigneshwer leading the introduction to rust and hands-on session. This was well taken by the participants who had just installed rust and exploring what they could do with the language.</p>

<p></p>
<p>With witty remarks, use cases and insights of the language, Vigneshwer kept the participants interested. During the hands-on he introduced the <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits">kits </a>built by the Rust India community and explained how participants could use them to learn the language. On the whole, it was a well-rounded session and helped the participants understand why rust is important and how they could contribute.</p>
<p>We then had a talk by Ravi from <a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/">Ather energy</a> which has used rust components to send  location data packets from its two-wheeler vehicles to the cloud in a secure and reliable fashion. His talk was inspirational as the participants were able to visualize how rust could be used in a production scenario.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For the last talk of the day, we had our own ReMo and host Sumantro show a demo on <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, a simple web framework for rust developers. This was in particular interest to me as a web developer, hitherto I was under the impression that rust could only be used for parallel computing and system level programming scenarios.  Now that I know rust has a fast and safe web framework, watch out JavaScript! Here’s Sumantro’s <a href="http://sumantrom.blogspot.in/2017/04/rocket-on-fedora.html">post </a>on how to set it up on Fedora.</p>
<div class="fb-social-plugin fb-post"></div>
<p> </p>
Last word
<p>On the whole it was personally fulfilling that we pulled off a workshop in ~1 week of planning and what was comforting was that the feedback we received through the new ReMo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/activate.mozilla.community/issues/210">feedback form</a> was a 6+ on a scale of 0-7. Yay!</p>
<p>Finishing off with a mighty group photo. A round of shout-outs to Bhumika and Ra Fey for helping us out with the posters and social media calls to action! You guys are wonderful. ^_^</p>

<p>Please join us in congratulating <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/dvigneshwer/" rel="nofollow noopener">Vigneshwer Dhinakaran</a>, our Rep of the Month for July 2017!</p>
<p>Vigneshwer is a data scientist working on realtime data and a tech enthusiast coming from India.</p>
<p><a href="https://scontent.fath3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16179241_1830873240462561_4074884736782256847_o.jpg?oh=3b7236a2a732a381422afc70b1bb1ed1&amp;oe=59F6B539" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">  </a>During the last months, Vigneshwer (or Viki as most of his friends call him) has been heavily involved on helping building the Rust community in India. His efforts, along with other awesome Reps, have resulted to the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/rain-of-rust-campaign-live/16020">RainofRust Campaign</a>, a campaign with the purpose to spread the Rust language in India and to create early adapters of the language. During the campaign Viki wrote a <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits" rel="nofollow noopener">new event flow</a> while he was leading a lot of the offline and online events. But his work doesn’t stop there. Since the campaign has finished, Viki is leading the efforts to help those early adopters to become Rust contributors in order to strengthen the community in India. Moreover, Viki has participated in the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/07/10/reps-mobilizer-experiment/" rel="nofollow noopener">mobilizers experiment</a> where he was leading the efforts on understanding how to mobilize the Rust community and unlock the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/results-of-the-mobilizer-experiment-for-rust-india/16558">challenges they are facing</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you Vigneshwer for being awesome, keep rocking the open Web!  </p>

                  <h5>Council at the All Hands in San Francisco</h5>
                    <h6>mkohler on July 25, 2017 11:05 AM</h6>
                    <p>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco">All Hands Wiki page</a> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about what we’ve accomplished in Q2 and the future of the program. One of our main topics was on how to get new developers involved as contributors in Mozilla projects.</p>
Top topics
<p>For that reason it was crucial to understand and discuss the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/07/10/reps-mobilizer-experiment/">mobilizers experiment</a> and their outcomes with Srushtika, Daniele and Vigneshwer, in order to understand what are the issues and needs for Add-ons, Rust and WebVR and how we can create communities around those projects and attract new developers.</p>
<p>The idea “Open by Design” was discussed extensively while we’ve tried to understand how Reps program can contribute to the Strategy project. We also had a meeting with Patrick Finch to discuss a few strategy questions and to start the discussion on how the Reps program can help in the next few months.</p>
<p></p>
Other meetings and sessions
<p>We had other sessions as well. Also we did a lot of administrative tasks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participated in the Q&amp;A Session with Chris Beard</li>
<li>Gave feedback on the <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2017/03/13/the-worldview-of-mozilla/">World View project</a></li>
<li>We reviewed our <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/04/20/reps-program-objectives-q2-2017/">Q2 OKRs</a> and opened <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues">issues</a> where necessary to continue in Q3</li>
<li>Updated the Wiki header of Reps pages with a link to the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Leadership">Leadership page</a></li>
<li>Moved the Council Chair from Konstantina to Flore</li>
<li>Started to document new criteria for Reps applications</li>
<li>Further documented the mobilizers initiative and discussed common topics that were raised around those</li>
<li>Had a meeting with Module Owner and Peers</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
MozActivate
<p><a href="http://activate.mozilla.community/">Activate</a> holds a special place at Reps activities. During the All Hands we held meetings about the website, the content of the activities and the future of the project. From the Council side Alex Lakatos with Michael Kohler are involved in the website building, while Konstantina Papadea and Ankit Gadgil are working with a focus on the content.</p>
<p>While in San Francisco we <a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/nightly/">launched a new activity about Nightly</a> which now is available on the website. Firefox Nightly is one of the most important projects happening right now in the Mozilla world and it’s crucial for us. We need to get new Firefox Nightly users.</p>
<p>We also joined discussions with the Rust and the Add-ons teams in order to better understand how the Reps Program can help to build their community or improve the promotion of those technologies.</p>
<p>On the feedback form front we are working on the dashboard to simplify the access to feedback of Activate events.</p>

<p>Growing up I was a tech geek, always kept myself updated with the latest ongoing in the language world. It always excited me to explore the tiny bits of these platforms and constantly kept myself updated with brushing my knowledge.</p>
<p>About 9 months ago I met <strong>Manish Goregaokar</strong>, who works in Mozilla as a Rust/Servo Contributor met me at Mozilla India meetup which was organized by Mozilla India team and I was one of the core team member organizing that event. He introduced me this programming language and gradually I became very fond of it, finding it very interesting and exciting to explore this language.</p>
<p>Eventually after spending some time, analyzing and exploring this programme, I discovered that masses including students, startups, developers are not completely aware, very few users actually being aware about Rust. Even after spending a quality time on this programming language, I still feel I have a whole new world to be discovered up in front of me. Simultaneously I thought it would be wise to educate users regarding Rust language. I seeked help from my mentors,friends and staff from Mozilla in setting up a campaign to spread awareness about Rust. This is how we came up with Rain Of Rust campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>About Rain Of Rust :</strong></p>
<p>Rain of Rust Campaign, a month-long global campaign in which would be specifically focused on the Rust language. It has taken place in June 2017 in collaboration with the Rust community.</p>
<p><strong>Key stats of RainOfRust campaign June 2017:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>19 offline events across 10 regions globally. Ref</li>
<li>4 online meeting which is recorded in Air Mozilla. Ref</li>
<li>As part of the campaign the RainOfRust has Rust teaching kits which currently has 3 application-oriented activities</li>
<li>The Github repo has received more than 500+ views in the within 1 month, <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/rain-of-rust-campaign-live/16020">Read more</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1343"></span></p>
<p>I contributed in Rust community by travelling across 8 cities in India through spreading awareness, educating and promoting Rust  amongst students, developers, entrepreneurs &amp; young aspirants.</p>

                  <h5>Reps Mobilizer Experiment</h5>
                    <h6>Ruben Martin [:Nukeador] on July 10, 2017 01:25 PM</h6>
                    <p>During the second quarter of 2017, and in order to understand how to better identify, recruit and support <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2017/02/13/reps-as-mobilizers-in-the-mozilla-community/">mobilizers</a>, we decided to run a small experiment with a reduced set of existing “best in class” mobilizers and walk with them during their work supporting technical communities.</p>
Why
<p>Reps program is a program for core mobilizers, who create, grow, sustain and engage communities around Mozilla projects. There are still improvement areas in order to become  a state of the art mobilizer program, so we wanted to identify which are these areas and which are the changes we can implement.</p>

<p> </p>
Process Overview
<p>We decided to use a human centered design approach to test this hypothesis. Each project started with a research phase followed by multiple iterations of potential solutions. Each iteration involved testing, reflecting on the learnings and iterating on the approach.</p>
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2017/07/Mobilizer-experiment-Workflow.png"></a>Overall main learnings
<ol>
<li>A certain degree of understanding of the technology is needed for the mobilizer to be truly effective and understand the communities.</li>
<li>It’s key to devote enough time to do research and understand the local environment and the potential contributors needs
<ol>
<li>After a solid research, we can start thinking on which are and implement the best channels for communications between the community (sync and async) as well as information distribution (announces, materials…)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are two important areas when working with technical communities:
<ol>
<li>Getting people excited about the tech and the community</li>
<li>Keeping people engaged after the main activities take place. The top priority should be designing for the follow-up instead of the activity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Establishing a direct conversation between mobilizers and the functional area staff is key for having a correct direction and impactful outputs.
<ol>
<li>Teams that work with more closed tools (slack) presented a bigger challenge</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of these learnings we will evaluate a set of recommendations to improve the Reps program and we will share with some early ideas soon on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/reps">Reps discourse</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you Vigneshwer, Daniele, Srushtika and Bob</strong>, your work is an inspiration to all Reps and to the rest of Mozilla, you have demostrated strong leadership and an impact-oriented strategy thinking that will help others to follow your steps.</p>

                  <h5>Let’s increase Firefox Market share</h5>
                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on July 02, 2017 06:40 AM</h6>
                    <div class="cooked">
<p>With the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Gal" rel="nofollow noopener">Andreas Gal’s</a> latest <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> it is quite clear that we are losing our market share and same can be seen on Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" rel="nofollow noopener">Usage Share Page</a>.</p>
<p>I am a Mozilla Rep. When I joined Mozilla 4 years back, I was literally knowing only three browsers <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>(thanks to Microsoft), <strong>Google Chrome</strong>(here due to Android) and <strong>Opera Mini</strong>(Only browser which uses less data then).<br />
But thanks to the community in Rajasthan which was so much active then, promoting Mozilla and it’s Mission. That was the first time when I get to know about Mozilla Firefox. Firefox is a product which is the core of Mozilla, this is what I believe and assume other volunteers,mozillians and Reps Share the same.</p>
<p>Today, Firefox is mainly used by Mozilla volunteers and few engineers that to are losing faith in it due to compatibility issue and other problems.To name a few, Hangout call is not supported by Firefox, which we use more often for our monthly meeting in India. So what we could do is, create a campaign just like Firefox Nightly and Rain of Rust to promote the use of Firefox, where we will introduce this browser to the students which are still unaware of the browser, which you may agree too.</p>
<p>We are a country with a population of over 1.311 billion where <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/At-315-million-India-has-the-most-students-in-world/articleshow/37669667.cms" rel="nofollow noopener">315 million</a> are students, if we could target those and industry people. This will definitely increase our market share.</p>
<p>I agree that Firefox sometimes doesn’t behave well and we lack other support too which is available in other browsers. I also see a great opportunity for us to make this browser more advanced and easy to use.We want a browser which we love. During this campaign, we will be collecting lots of feedback and suggestions and how you want this browser for yourself. Then we will share these reports with Mozilla staff and help them to create a browser which people love.</p>
<p>I would love to know your feedback and suggestion regarding this campaign as well as any correction will be appreciatable.</p>
<p>Please follow this <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/lets-increase-firefox-market-share/16793" rel="noopener" target="_blank">topic</a> on discourse for more updates</p>

                  <h5>Why you should contribute to Open Source</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on June 26, 2017 11:41 AM</h6>
                    <p>My first step with FOSS was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/how-dgplug-training-is-proving-beneficial-to-me.html">during the summer of 2014</a>, where I got introduced to <a class="reference external" href="http://dgplug.org">DGPLUG</a> (Durgapur Linux Users Group). Every year, they conduct a training over IRC covering a wide range of topics. Since then, I've been contributing to different projects, primarily to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">Mozilla's Gecko Engine</a>. Recently I also started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr%20author%3ACuriousLearner">contributing to CPython</a>.</p>
<p>Over <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CuriousLearner/">this journey as CuriousLearner over the past few years</a>, I've been fortunate enough to collaborate with some of the best engineers, learnt a lot of skills &amp; gained some nice perspective on different technologies by just contributing to Open Source. I owe my learning to them.</p>
<p>I've been always asked this question by my friends, colleagues, and strangers whom I often run into in local meet-ups and conferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why should I contribute to Open Source</li>
<li>What's in it for me</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I thought I would cover this topic from the perspective of a student as well as the perspective of a working professional.</p>
<div class="section" id="learn-new-skills">
Learn new skills
<p>When I say skills, I'm not referring to just coding skills or learning yet another framework. There are tons of skills to be learnt. These include coding, debugging, testing, writing docs, collaboration, participating in meetings etc. In FOSS, you won't just learn technical skills, but soft skills as well. That means you'll learn how to communicate effectively over different mediums and making sense to other people who might be from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>I've seen many engineers are hesitant when it comes to communication. They can think and write really nice code, but when it comes to explaining themselves, they lack the communication skills, which is vital to be a better professional.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improve-existing-skills">
Improve existing skills
<p>It's not always about learning a new tech that you heard about. It's important to improve on things you think <em>you might already know</em>. Contributing to a FOSS project would make you learn intricate details that your mentors have gained working as a software craftsmen for several years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meet-like-minded-people">
Meet like-minded people
<p>Many organizations do stand-up / all-hands meetings where everyone comes together and explains what are they're working on, what they plan to do next and if they face any blocker. So, students, there is a high possibility that when you graduate, you'll do this in your organization :) You'll meet a lot of people having similar interests and you'll learn a lot of things just by hanging out with them (most of the time on IRC).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-people-skills">
Learn people skills
<p>Learn team management, resolving internal conflicts, brainstorming on a new feature, public-speaking, time-management, conducting meet-ups &amp; learn to prioritize your work. You will just expand your horizons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-to-read">
Learn to READ
<p>One of the best things I've been ever taught is to "READ". (And those who've met me personally knows how many times I've been repeating this thing :)).</p>
<p>When I say read, I mean you'll read the documentation, development guide and most importantly the source code.</p>
<p>Always remember that code is meant to be read more times than it is written. When you contribute to any FOSS project, one of the important skill you add to your skill-set is to make your brain make sense out of the code that may look gibberish to many people.</p>
<p>This is a very important skill. Once you're in a company, you'll be given the responsibility of maintaining huge code base and constantly adding features to it. There won't be someone who would spoon-feed you by explaining what every line of code means.</p>
<p>I've seen many people struggling hard in their jobs to figure out what a particular piece of code does. But if you've already worked with humongous code bases, this shall be a cake-walk for you. You would already know how to scrutinize bugs, debug errors and most importantly, would have already taught your brain to think and <cite>READ</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-mentors">
Find mentors
<p>FOSS is all about mentors &amp; mentees. There are people just like me and you who volunteer their time and skill to do good for the community. You'll find a lot of mentors who would be willing to teach you different skills. Remember, that you've got this opportunity to learn from domain experts :)</p>
<p>And no matter what, always respect everyone's time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teach-others">
Teach others
<p>While it is important to get your code reviewed, it is much more important to review other's code. This would help you in learning different coding style and also about how someone approached a particular problem. This would help in expanding your logical skills &amp; as always you'll be learning a lot yourself along the way with having healthy discussions in code reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-feels-great-to-make-small-changes">
It feels great to make (small) changes
<p>You don't necessarily need to work on big features in a project or become a life-long contributor. Contribute to a project that you use on daily basis (like <a class="reference external" href="https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">Mozilla Firefox</a>) and I promise you that it would be gratifying when you see the whole world rely on the small code changes you did.</p>
<p>A small change in the documentation means you might save someone countless hours of debugging and scratching their head on how to use a particular piece of code. Always remember, documentation bugs are not something inferior; you'll learn a lot in writing documentation, right from the tools such as Sphinx and rST to expanding your domain knowledge about the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-your-reputation-career-along-the-way">
Building your reputation (&amp; career) along the way
<p>All the code you'll write in Open Source projects would be public and can be taken as a demonstration of how you write code &amp; what you can do. It depicts how you work with others and most importantly give you an enormous amount of experience in working with people having diversified skill-set.</p>
<p>Once you get acquainted with the code base, you'll be invited to develop stand-alone features and who knows you might get that commit bit turned on when you've developed enough reputation in the community ;)</p>
<p>Apart from all the things mentioned above, I think Mozilla's mission says a lot about why I contribute to FOSS</p>
<blockquote>
Doing good is part of our code</blockquote>
<p>Alright, I didn't realize, I'll be able to write this much. Hopefully, this would help &amp; motivate people to get involved in contributing to Open Source. As always, if you have any queries, or want help in contributing to any project, feel free to mail me on <strong>Sanyam [at] SanyamKhurana [dot] com</strong>.</p>

                  <h5>Kashmir Uses Firefox Nightly</h5>
                    <h6>Tanzeel Khan on May 25, 2017 03:55 PM</h6>
                    <p></p>
<p>The event was a part of PAN India pilot campaign for Firefox Nightly aimed to create a strong technical community who will be using and testing Nightly on a regular basis. Besides, it was a meetup for community members in the region. The event <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/kashmir-uses-firefox-nightly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kashmir Uses Firefox Nightly</a> was organised at Bangs, Srinagar on 25th May, 2017.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We started with the brief Introduction about Mozilla, its projects and programs and its local community in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. We then introduced the attendees to Firefox Nightly, why do we have this version of firefox, why should we use it and what are the benefits. Then the steps to download, install and the filing of bug was shown. Few attendees installed the browser and also signed up for an account on Bugzilla.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>We also discussed WebCompat and how to contribute to it.</p>
<p>Besides, the attendees were introduced to the projects and programs of Mozilla that are currently in focus. WebVR, Rust, WebCompat to name a few. We also devised a plan for the local community as to what activities to take out in the coming months.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>The attendees shared content about the event and the Firefox Nightly Browser online with the hashtag #INUsesFxNightly.</p>

                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on May 16, 2017 04:31 AM</h6>
                    <p><span class="">It was an initiative to run a pilot campaign for <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/jaipur-uses-firefox-nightly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly in Jaipur</a> as it is happening throughout India. Through this event we wanted be building strong technical community in Jaipur which will be using and testing Nightly on a regular basic which is a great way to get involved to a Mozilla project.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Event started with a brief introduction of Mozilla and What is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Nightly#What_is_Firefox_Nightly.3F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly</a>? And then we have shared the nightly file so that everyone has nightly browser to explore and use on a daily basis. As they were installing on their computer I talked about importance of nightly user and what great impact it gives back to community when we use this browser and file a bug if any in nightly browser.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/jaipur-uses-firefox-nightly/18486436_1699395803409501_859767328494890206_n/"></a>

<p>After the installation we have discussed about two methods of filing bug. One for the browser specific , use <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bugzilla</a> and for website which are not compatible in nightly, use <a href="http://webcompat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">webcompat</a> . Also gave a demo of <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_the_Nightly_Tester_Tools_extension.3F"><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/nightly-tester-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nightly Tester Tools extension</a> and how they an use it in the browser.<br />
</span></p>
<p>During the event we shared <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mdsbzalam/posts/1699396156742799?pnref=story" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pictures</a> on social media and used profile changer and shared the details of campaign and nightly on twitter. Also one of the participant filed two bugs,<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364735" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> one on bugzilla</a> and <a href="https://webcompat.com/issues/6694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one on webcompat</a> . Everyone will be using this browser on a daily basis and we are looking forward for more bugs to be filed .</p>

                    <p>When you see people around you, have enough potential to lead a project or be a mentor to someone . Its your duty to guide them to a proper channel so that they follows the same. Recently I became Mozilla Rep , went to the same place where I organized my first Mozilla <a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/jnuwebday-my-first-event-as-a-host/" target="_blank">event</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this event we focused on guiding new members to a proper channel and passing the roles and responsibilities to Active members . Event started with a general introduction of Open Source and how Mozilla is related to it. Ways to contribute in Mozilla. And other areas of contribution. In this process we have filtered the participants and get to know they all are technically sound and have come to this event to learn something new .</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we split the participants into two group where we had a small session of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions" target="_blank">WebExtension</a> and they developed their first add-on. Everyone was Excited!!! to see their work in front of their eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the event we had a group picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More pics : <a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/116868207@N06/50r5F9" target="_blank">flick</a></p>
<p>We then proceeds towards discussing new plans for the community and how to track them .</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Events in 10 Different Colleges of Rajasthan. Introduction of Mozilla and establishment of a Mozilla Club in their college, so that we can have a channel to be in touch with them and guide them on a regular basis.</li>
<li>3 Hackathons based on Rust, WebVR and Firefox in general which will include other development sessions such as WebExtensions,QA and l10n.</li>
<li>MozCoffee Event with the Club lead of all the Colleges and few active contributors in my community to guide them to be a mentor not a leader.</li>
<li>Each month at least 3 colleges, 1 Hackathon and 1 Meetup.</li>

                    <p></p>
<p>With the help of the contributors, we aim to explore Test Pilot as a hope to test the experimental add-ons, find issues, file bugs and document.</p>
<p>Event was organized in MCR Community House with the MCR members and QA Analyst <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Madhuri_QA/" target="_blank">Madhuri Mittal</a> . Test Pilot was introduced to the participants and everyone installed the add-ons listed on the <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com" target="_blank">TestPilot website</a> .</p>
<p>Everyone loved the Snooze Tab, Page Shot , Tab Center and Containers and played with the other add-ons too. After the initial over view of the Add-ons , we performed the Test Cases and how to identify a bug, where to report and how to track that bug was discussed with the participants.</p>
<p>After the initial impression of add-ons , we were excited to develop our own add-ons. Then <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/osho/" target="_blank">Osho parth</a> took a small session of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions" target="_blank">WebExtensions</a> where we followed the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension" target="_blank">First WebExtension</a> and Second <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension" target="_blank">WebExtension </a>. Looking forward to contribute more on WebExtension , QA and TestPilot.</p>

                    <p></p>
<p>It all started in the month of January when i requested Mehul Patel to file an event on behalf of me. He is a helpful person who really want to spread the Mozilla Love to all corners of India not only to his region. I met him during the MakerParty’17 in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>So he filed the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozactivate-mits/" target="_blank">event</a> and he make sure that everything is arranged. As the time come for the event which is 18th and 19th Feb, 2017 I was informed by one of the Club member of Mozilla MITS that their administration in not allowing them to have this event. So we have to postpone the dates as they are willing to have this event after Holi ( i.e during 18th-19th March ) but it didn’t happen again. So finally after this much effort and continuous rejection few members of the Club is ready to attend this event and get back to their college and take a fresh start.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning when students from MITS came to jaipur for a meeting where we discussed about the failure of their club and what all difficulties they were facing. It was a wonderful time to introduce the Collaborative Club culture where clubs from different cities which work together to accomplish a common goal.</p>
<p>Unicorn Club members also came to the venue where they have said the same problem as MITS said.<strong> How to Start ? Where to start with ? And What we need to do as a beginner ?</strong></p>
<p>Event started with a brief introduction of all of the participant and answer to a question. What problem did he faced in Mozilla Club?</p>
<p>So here goes the structure I presented them :</p>
<ul>
<li>Join the proper information channel from where they’ll get to know what is happening in Mozilla in general. eg Facebook Group,Telegram,Discourse, mailing-list.</li>
<li>I told them my story , how I came in mozilla and what mozilla gave me.</li>
<li>Mozilla Campus Club. What is it? How they can get the benefits? What all activities they can do.</li>
<li>WebVR , What is WebVR and how to get started in A-frame.</li>
<li>MozActivate’s projects: Rust,WebVR,TestPilot and WebCompat were discussed and how to get started with these.</li>
<li>As a fresher they can start with QA, L10n and SuMo what they were already doing in past.</li>
<li>We prepared a time line where each club will be having a small sprint of each projects discussed above. To start with they will have a follow up event where they will be testing add-ons listed in TestPilot website.</li>
<li>Also they were told about the necessary things they have to do before and after the event. Involve , spread and share about the their event in proper medium and blog,pictures and feedback after the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we had an awesome lunch with all the participants. They really loved the food…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the lunch we had a basic WebVR session where the MITS members learn about A-frame in detail also experienced the scenes on VR-Box. I had few swags to give away for the members of MITS which I distributed with them.</p>

                  <h5>Joining the Mozilla Creative Team</h5>
                    <h6>elioqoshi on April 02, 2017 09:24 AM</h6>
                    <p><a href="https://mozilla.org"></a></p>
<p>A day after April Fool’s, it seems like the right time to announce the news: I’m joining the Mozilla Creative Team as a design contractor starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is a major step and honor for me to work among one of the most influential design teams in the open source industry, closely involved with community and one which strives to be as decentralized as possible, in a world where latter seems unthinkable to do. When I started contributing to Mozilla 4 years ago, I missed any opportunities to get involved on a design level within the community, regardless if Branding, UI or UX. I’m happy that nowadays the landscape is more inclusive towards community designers, where I’d like to note the <a href="https://elioqoshi.me/2016/08/mozilla-rebranding-notes/">major open rebranding process we undertook last year</a>, and the launch of the<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/opendesign"> Open Design repo</a> for communities to process design requests and have monthly meetings.</p>
<p>With the new Mozilla brand being launched 2 months ago, a great amount of work still lies before us. Apart from applying the new visual language across Mozilla’s websites and communication channels, we have to figure out how Communities are involved with the new identity, to make it feel consistent, yet flexible and inclusive for a wide range of communities.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1755"><p class="wp-caption-text">With the Creative Team at the All-Hands Work Week in Hawaii last year.</p></div>
<p>My work will encompass exactly this and work closer with the community to strengthen the bridge between Staff and Contributors and offer ways for design contributors to get involved in a similar manner as developers in open source. With Mozilla being one of the leading forces of diverse contributor backgrounds in open source, it completely makes sense to make this the next step.</p>
<p>My work will be closely tied with values we share at <a href="https://ura.design/">Ura Design</a> and <a href="http://opensourcedesign.net/">Open Source Design</a>, which have taught me invaluable lessons in the past. I look forward to turning them into practice and update you soon on the actual projects we are working on.</p>

                  <h5>India uses Firefox Nightly – A Campaign especially for India</h5>
                    <h6>birajkarmakar on March 30, 2017 03:51 PM</h6>
                    <p>Fellow mozillians, I am super excited to inform you that very soon we are going to release a new campaign in India  called “<a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/india-uses-firefox-nightly/">India uses Firefox Nightly</a>“. Behind this campaign, our mission is <span style="font-weight: 400;">to increases <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org">Firefox nightly </a>usages in India. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://birajkarmakar.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/india-uses-firefox-nightly-a-campaign-especially-for-india/sticker_sample/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1364"></a></p>
<p><strong>Why India?</strong></p>
<p>As we all know <span style="font-weight: 400;">we have a great Mozilla community around India. We have a large number of dedicated students, developers and evangelists who are really passionate about Mozilla. We have seen that very few people in India actually know about Firefox Nightly. So we have taken an initiative to run a pilot campaign for <span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefox Nightly throughout India. Firefox Nightly, as a pre-release version of Firefox targeting power-users and core Mozilla contributors, is a glimpse of what the future of Firefox will be for hundreds of millions of people. Having a healthy and strong technical community using and testing Nightly is a great way to easily get involved in Mozilla by providing a constant feedback loop to developers.</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here you can test lots of pre-release features. So it needs little bit of general promotion, which will pump to bring a good number of tech-savvy, power users who will be our active community members.</span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Few Key points</span>
<p><b>Time Frame: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 months Max              </span><b>Hashtag: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">#INUsesFxNightly</span></p>
<p><strong>Event Duration: </strong>3 – 5 Hours             <strong> Total events:</strong> 15</p>
<p><b>Who will join us: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite students, community member, developer, open source evangelist to run this campaign.</span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parts of Campaign </span>
Online activities:
<p>Mozillians spread the message of this campaign around the India as well as through social media (facebook, twitter, Instagram), blog, <span style="font-weight: 400;">promotional </span>snippet, email,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mailing list, website news item</span> etc.</p>
Offline activities:
<p>Here any community member or open source enthusiasts can host one event in his area or join any nearby event for helping organisers. The event can be held at <span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Company, School, University, Community centre, Home, Café. </span></p>
<b>Goals for this initiative</b>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1000 Nightly Installed</span></li>

                  <h5>My dream project – Digital Literacy Camp 2017</h5>
                    <h6>birajkarmakar on March 23, 2017 12:59 PM</h6>
                    <p>Sorry, for posting this late. Actually last few months I was so busy. That’s why I could not write this here.</p>
<p>As you all know, the world has now transformed into a global village and the digital literacy movement will touch every city one by one. Lack of web literacy can push young minds to the darkness of ignorance, where no dreams prosper. That’s why I started this initiative called “<strong>Digital Literacy Camp 2017</strong>“- this is my dream project.</p>
<p>So let me introduce you all to my <strong>Dream Project</strong> – <strong><a href="https://digitalcamp2017.tumblr.com/post/154066934090/digital-literacy-camp-2017">Digital Literacy Camp 2017</a></strong> – aim to reach 100 students in my city and make them powerful web citizens, transforming the little part of our whole country.</p>
<p>I started my campaign in various crowd fudging site from <strong>December 1st week’16.</strong></p>
<p>Our training period starting from <strong>1st Mar to 31st May 2017</strong>. So we already started our training……..</p>
<p>This is three months staggered campaign to educate 100 underprivileged students on and prepare them for a better tomorrow. Here we have 100 Students from the unprivileged community. 1 Common dream. The Desire to learn – <strong>Basic Computer Learning, Internet &amp; Web <span class="m_707744728426875313m_8245081716060758696gmail-il">Literacy</span>, Spoken English and Smartphone usage.</strong></p>
Why this 100 students from the underprivileged community:
<p>Some children are born to lead. But at some point time, these students are always used to hear “NO”, because of their economic condition but we are saying “Yes” to their dreams. Our goal is to open a whole new world to these underprivileged children by fueling their curiosity. It is not just about education, we will help these kids learn effective skills through fun activities. Let’s work together to empower a generation of digitally literate citizens. They are here to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
Our campaign video:
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
Our goal:
<p>After three months’ training, the students will:</p>
<p>1. Understand the working of a computer and know about the various programs.</p>
<p>2. Use English while communicating with others. 50% of the content produced on the internet is written in English, so the spoken English skills will come in handy.</p>
<p>3. Utilise the power of the internet to understand the world in a better way. Explore the new way of learning through the Internet. They can know more about privacy on their online life. They must know how to connect online and utilise the online resources.</p>
<p>4. They can know how the smartphone can transform their life. Also, we have selected some fun activities which will not only keep them interested but also develop a learning spirit in them. These beautiful minds will; get the best resources from us and that included proper infrastructure, skilled trainers, study material, the internet and skill-based class training.</p>
Impact:
<p>Students are bombarded with tonnes of information every single day and it is very hard for them to retain the right information. We must concentrate our efforts on making them effective consumers of information. Digital footprints are permanent and if they lack digital knowledge, they will never develop the ability to differentiate between what is trustworthy on the web and what is not. As they are proceeding down this path, these young students are growing their vocabulary, learning how to do research and most importantly their critical thinking skills are developed. The little joys are priceless. The smile on their faces encourages us to work harder. If a little move can create so much difference in their life, we can definitely do bigger things for them. Bigger things can bring bigger changes. Teaching with a difference can make learning easy.</p>
We already started our training

                    <h6>Irvin Chen (noreply@blogger.com) on March 15, 2017 03:08 AM</h6>
                    <p><em>“摩茲工寮, Mozilla Community Space Taipei”</em> is an event/meeting/working space and shelter to the local Mozillians, Mozilla volunteers, and OSS communities.</p>
<p>It is the first of three spaces besides <a href="http://www.mozspacemnl.org/">Manila Space</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.mozilla.or.id/space.html">Jakarta Space</a>. The spaces are leading by Mozilla Open Innovation Group's “<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Community_Spaces">community spaces</a>” project, managing by local MozTW volunteers.</p>
<p>Here I will share about some brief status of the Taipei Space.</p>
<p>(I'll use “MozTW Space” or “Space” as the abbreviation to “Mozilla Community Space Taipei” below.)</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
MozTW Community
<p>Mozilla Taiwan Community (MozTW) is a local Mozilla volunteer community. We had contributing by localizing, promoting Firefox, Mozilla and open cultures to Mozilla and open source projects since 2004.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>MozTW maintained an online <a href="https://moztw.org">product portal and forum</a>, hosting <a href="https://moztw.org/events/">many offline events</a> and engaging with other Asia Mozillians and open source hackers.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
History of Space
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>The Community Space was an idea initially raised by William Quiviger in 2013, and sponsored by WPR team. We started the first experimental space in Taipei spring 2014.</p>
<p>After April 2016, the space project had transitioned to Participation Team, supported by Brian King. In February 2017, it has been transitioned to Open Innovation Group with the help by George Roter and Konstantina.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
Keyholders
<p>MozTW Space is co-managing by “Keyholder,” 15 local Mozilla volunteers. Keyholders are all vouched Mozillians, and has same privilege. People need to be countersigned by more than 50% of Mozillian visitors (in last three months) when they applied for the position. The threshold represents the community's support to the applicant.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
Visitors &amp; Events
<p>Everyone is welcome to visiting MozTW space when there is any Keyholder inside. However, it's not opening 24 hours / 7 days a week due to the volunteers ability. In last three years, we managed to open the space 20~25 days per month in average. (mostly
    the night time)</p>
<p>Besides Mozilla events, we also welcome and support all open culture and programming communities to hosting their events in the MozTW Space. Totally there are more than <strong>8000 visitors</strong> and <strong>760 events</strong> since May 2014.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Some of the most closing cooperate communitiess including <a href="http://g0v.tw">G0V</a>, <a href="http://openstreetmap.tw">OSM</a>, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Taiwan">Wikimedia Taiwan</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.tw/%3Cbr%3E">Creative Commons Taiwan</a>,
    <a href="http://ocf.tw">Open Culture Foundation</a>, <a href="http://sitcon.org/">SITCON</a> (Students Information Technology Conference) and <a href="http://www.wofoss.org/">WoFOSS</a> (Women in Free and Open Source Software in Taiwan).</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>One of the primary goals is to introduce Mozilla and our belief to new friends. In last six month (Sep-Feb), more than 410 visitors had learned about Mozilla on their first visit to the Space (out of 1800 visitors in 167 events).</p>
<p>We introduce Mozilla, Manifesto, our different projects, topics around internet health and policy, and new technologies we're building.</p>
Dev-rel
<p>Since Dec 2015, we put emphasis on developer relationship. There are 168 developer events, and we introduce Rust, Servo, HTML5, WebAPI and developer tools to more than 4000 local programmers.</p>
Social Engagement
<p>On social engagement, we had received 2550 Check-ins and 1100 Likes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MozSpaceTPE/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://https://foursquare.com/v/%E6%91%A9%E8%8C%B2%E5%B7%A5%E5%AF%AE-mozilla-community-space-taipei/5370b8a1498e8c14504d0007">Foursquare</a>.
    And in fact, we didn't ask people to do it. These social channels had become a good way for us to promoting openness.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>And we issue Open Badges...</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>… to the visitors around the world - including <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/surman/">Mark Surman</a>, <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/kinger/">Brian King</a>, <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/lshapiro/">Larissa Shapiro</a>, <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/williamq/">William Quiviger</a>, <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/dietrich/">Dietrich Ayala</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maxogden">Max Ogden</a>, <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/history/people/faculty/fan.html">Fa-ti Fan</a>, <a href="http://weibo.com/81691005">田爱娜</a> and many more.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
MozTW Lab
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>One of the best events is “<a href="http://moztw.org/events/moztw-lab/">MozTW Lab</a>,” Mozillian weekly meetup on each Friday night. Volunteers get together to socialize, work, and give lightning talks on various topics including Mozilla's latest update.</p>
<p>This meetup had been running for seven years, and there are 77 lightning talk sessions recorded/live broadcasted through Vidyo from Space since 2014.</p>

                  <h5>Mozilla at 4CCON</h5>
                    <h6>Abhiram on February 19, 2017 05:15 PM</h6>
                    <p>I’m writing a blog post after a long, long time and the reason why I’ve been dormant is because I’ve not done anything of significance for the past 6 months. As I’m writing this, I’m also watching the US Open Semifinals between Rafa and Dimitrov (the 5th set is on and I really hope Rafa wins this one! *fingers crossed*).</p>
<p>Back to my story, I had the wonderful opportunity to represent <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozilla-privacy-talk-4ccon-conference/">Mozilla at 4CCON</a> (Collaboration, Contribution, Communities and Commons) which is a National Level Conference organized by FSMI, a premier free software organization in India. I was invited to give an advanced workshop on using Selenium for testing web applications using Python on the Firefox browser.</p>
<p>The session went well, initially with 15 participants which later swelled into a crowd of 50 participants. The conference had workshops in a variety of topics and my session was scheduled to be on the first day – the 26th of January. Incidentally, it was the Republic Day of the country – I feel good sharing the things I’ve learned and practiced on the very day the Indian Constitution came into effect, over 60 years ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The full day workshop started off with a quick introduction on Python as a programming language, moving on to the uses and applications of the Selenium test framework and most importantly – the significance of unit testing. I highlighted the various API methods that Python developers could use to test a simple web page. The entire slide deck of the 1 day workshop is hosted online <a href="http://slides.com/abhiramravikumar/python-selenium-11#/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the later half of the day, I made the participants set up a basic website on their own and test for simple elements on the page like Dialog Boxes, Forms and Links. The participants found it interesting to inspect the DOM (Document Object Model) structure of their favorite websites and give various test scenarios and the exciting part was when they actually found a few bugs.</p>
<p>At the end of my workshop, I had a section on Open Source projects and how the participants could contribute. I shared stories of many successful people who started off fixing the odd bug here and there – are now the leaders in their technology fields. This was found to be inspirational by the participants there.</p>

<p>During the next 2 days of the conference I was invited as a delegate and attended various keynotes apart from meeting many FOSS enthusiasts whom I had met only virtually, hitherto.</p>
<p>On the whole, it was a productive workshop and I hope the participants will take up open source contribution and do justice to the enthusiasm they’ve displayed.</p>
<p>Chennai has grown in leaps, I hope to see better things in the days to come. </p>

                    <p>It feels like yesterday when I had my first<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/"> FOSDEM</a>, Yet more than 3 years passed and my 4th edition of FOSDEM is behind me as well. Throughout all 4 years I have been part of the Mozilla presence, regardless if as a Mozilla Rep, l10n contributor or Tech Speaker. I can only appreciate the great moments we shared with fellow attendees at FOSDEM. It has been a rollercoaster of emotions, sobriety, hangoverness and swag every year, and this year has been no different.</p>

<p>Unlike the other years, 10 people from our local <a href="https://openlabs.cc">Open Labs Hackerspace</a> attended FOSDEM 2017. That’s 10 Albanians too much already.<br />
As part of the Open Source Design collective, I have been helping out with the organization of the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/open_source_design/">Open Source Design (dev)room this year at FOSDEM</a>. I was happy to give a talk about<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign"> Mozilla Open Design </a>and the new branding of Mozilla introduced just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>In the past year, I have been trying to not break my routine too much while traveling. Conferences are great and inspiring but it can be pretty demanding to fully emerge yourself into the conference experience if you travel frequently. As a part-time introvert, I tend to relax in my hotel for quite a few hours, at least every 2 days, something which has worked for me quite well in the past. Not at FOSDEM however.</p>

<p>There are way too many people you want to catch up with and way too much going on as well. With FOSDEM fringe there is also a great number of events which happen before and after FOSDEM, due to so many different projects already having presence during that week, making it easier to meet in person. I failed to meet with several people I wanted to catch up with, but it’s kind of expected at such a large event as FOSDEM.</p>
<p>During peak times, it was reported that 18000 devices were connected to the WiFi network. It’s a good estimate of the number of attendees at the event. Crazy indeed. The proportions of FOSDEM are immense.</p>
<p><a href="http://baggerspion.net/2017/02/fosdem-2017/">There is a Survival Guide by Paul Adams I highly recommend however</a>. If you think of attending FOSDEM next year, be prepared. It’s pretty demanding physically and emotionally, especially if you can’t get used to the feeling of “missing out”. Let me clarify it for you here:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You will miss out a lot of things at FOSDEM. You can not do much about it. Embrace it and you will enjoy it even more.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What I really dislike at FOSDEM is the lack of any relaxing zones and the limited selection of (junk) food. It is very demanding for your mind and body to not have proper food, hydration and sleep. Be prepared for that. If you plan to attend FOSDEM, try to stay an additional night in Brussels (or depart late on Monday) because you need the energy to refuel. If you think you are thick-skinned however, you should be doing quite fine.</p>

<p>The day after FOSDEM, we met with some of the key players for Free and Open Source Software in the European Parliament &amp; Commision. We had a great time talking about our experience with our local public administrations and their status regarding Free Software. We are looking forward to continue this discussions at <a href="https://oscal.openlabs.cc">OSCAL’17</a> which happens in May.</p>

                  <h5>NIEC Activate Mozilla with WebVR</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on January 29, 2017 06:38 AM</h6>
                    <p>On Saturday, January 28, 2017, we had an event planned at Northern India Engineering College on <tt class="docutils literal">Activate Mozilla Campaign</tt>. Our aim was to cover <cite>WebVR</cite> track under <tt class="docutils literal">Build the Web</tt> activity.</p>
<p>The event was scheduled from 12:00 PM IST to 4:00 PM IST.</p>
<p>I reached the venue at 10:40 AM and helped a bit with arrangements. Saturday was a day off for all college students, so honestly I didn't expect much audience.</p>
<p>But, I was wrong. Students are more willing to learn and soon there were lot of students. In starting there were less people, but then we got a total audience of around 70+ which is huge considering that it was a holiday for them and they just came here to learn about FOSS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, out of the core-organizers, only Shivam was available. But we got support from other student volunteers to do various arrangements and co-ordinating all the sessions smoothly. I would take this opportunity to thank each one of them.</p>
<p>Since, there were no other speakers, I had to take all the sessions. It began with an interactive session on what students understand by the term FOSS (Free &amp; Open Source Software). I told about how Free Software and Open Source Software are same yet different from each other.</p>

<p>After this we discussed about Mozilla and the Open Web. Since it was <tt class="docutils literal">Data Privacy Day</tt>, we also discussed about how important is privacy in the online world, yet most of us don't have proper information on it. We also discussed about <cite>Free Basics</cite> and how various organizations keep track of our online identities; and how Mozilla as an organization is doing in protecting the Free Web.</p>
<p>Next session was on <cite>Introduction to Git &amp; Github</cite>. Although focus was on Activate Mozilla campaign, but I really wanted to teach about Version control to people considering that most people are Engineering students.</p>


<p>After this we had a small break to let people grab the knowledge they just had. I was surprised by the enthusiasm of these students. In the break time too, many of them surrounded me with various questions like how to contribute to FOSS, how to start et. all. So, yes, it wasn't a break for me ;)</p>
<p>After this session, we jumped on to Activate Mozilla Campaign. We told about various tracks under Activate Mozilla Campaign. The session was kick started with an introduction to Virtual Reality. We discussed about Visual and Input Immersion and how it is changing the Web as we use it today.</p>
<p>After this, we jumped on to learning A-Frame and making Virtual Reality scenes.</p>




<p>Then we gave time to audience to try using A Frame to develop something. I will collect all those projects and post them here soon :)</p>
<p>In the end we distributed swags to students.</p>


<p>After the event, we took feedback from people. Some of them are here:</p>




<p>Out of these, I'm astonished to see, that 100% people want to learn more about it. One student wrote that he would really like if more simpler terms would be used. Surely, I would keep this in mind, and if someone told me this thing during the session, I would've helped them there itself. But I'd surely take care from next session.</p>
<p>And there is some MozLove on twitter as well :)</p>


<p>Now, I'm flooded with a lot of mails from students who're willing to contribute to FOSS and requesting for guidance. I have started replying to some, and will be replying to all of them soon.</p>

                    <p>When choosing the right suggestion to approve, it’s sometimes hard to see how they differ among each other, especially if the difference is relatively small compared to the suggestion length.</p>
<p>Which is why <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/">Pontoon</a> now lets you see the diff against the translation in the editing field. You can reveal it by clicking on the “Show diff” button.</p>

    <h2>Cool!</h2>
    <p>
      The Mozilla Reps program is open to all Mozillians who are 18 years
      of age and above. Before you become a Mozilla Rep, you must
      complete a short but rigorous application process in order to
      demonstrate your interest in and motivation for joining the
      program. Are you ready to take on the challenges and rewards
      of advancing your leadership to the next level in Mozilla? If
      your answer is YES, apply to become a Mozilla Rep today!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not sure if you're ready for Mozilla Reps? There are many other
      ways to take the lead in the Mozilla Community. If you're a
      student, register for
      the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Student_Reps">Firefox
      Student Ambassadors
      </a> program to gain experience leading projects at your
      school. And all of our contributor opportunities are available
      to you on the <a href="https://mozilla.org/contribute">Get
      Involved homepage</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mozilla Reps application process involves three simple
      steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Fill out and submit the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.reps.mentorship">
          Mozilla Reps application form</a>.
        A Mozilla Rep mentor will be in touch within 24 hours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>If your application is approved, you'll be invited to be
        interviewed by a member of the advisory council over IRC or
        IM that same week. The interview lasts about 15 minutes and
        you will be asked some simple questions about yourself, your
        experience contributing to the Mozilla project and, of
        course, your motivation for becoming a MozRep.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          If you're accepted into the Mozilla Reps program, your
          mentor will get you started and familiar with the tools at
          your disposal to start organizing events, requesting
          budgets, swag, etc. And just like that, you could become a
          Mozilla Rep!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in making the Web better with Mozilla!</p>
