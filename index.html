                  <h5>Community Coordinator role</h5>
                    <h6>kpapadea on October 10, 2018 12:56 PM</h6>
                    <p>The Reps program is evolving in order to be aligned with Mozilla’s changes on how we perceive communities. Part of those changes is the Mission Driven Mozillians project, where the Reps are involved.</p>
<p>We (the Reps Council) believe that the Reps program has a natural place inside this project because of the experience, skills and knowledge on leading, growing and helping communities on their daily life.</p>
<p>Based on  the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/what-s-next-for-volunteer-leadership-in-2018-shared-agreements/25091">work that has been done in the Mission Driven Mozillians project</a> (video: <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/a-quick-video-intro-to-mission-driven-mozillians/25912">https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/a-quick-video-intro-to-mission-driven-mozillians/25912</a>), two types of volunteer leadership have been identified:</p>
<ol>
<li>Volunteers who have been identified inside the community as experts based on their knowledge and skills on a specific functional area – <b><i>functional area experts</i></b></li>
<li>Volunteers who have been identified as experts based on their ability to coordinate, support and expand communities  – <b><i>community coordinators.</i></b></li>
</ol>
<p>For the first category, functional areas are able to easily identify the right fit for the position based on different knowledge criterias and years of experience in the project. However, for the second category there is not a well defined role nor a set of guidelines for volunteers that were interested in community building. As a result, historically, people from the first category took over the community coordinator roles without necessarily being properly trained for it.</p>
<p>For that reason, the Reps Council has worked on a definition of the community coordinator role, since we believe that the Reps are a natural fit for this role.</p>
<p><b>Suggested definition of community coordinator role:</b></p>
<p>Community coordinator volunteers are a<i>ligned and committed Mozillians who are interested in:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>finding and connecting new talent with Mozilla projects they are contributing to</i></li>
<li><i>developing communities on a functional and/or local level</i></li>
<li><i>supporting local communities and Mozilla to </i>have an effective and decentralized environment for contribution</li>
<li><i>creating collaborations with other local communities in an effort to spread Mozilla’s mission and expand Mozilla’s outreach in the open source ecosystem</i></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to be able to describe the responsibilities of the role more, we have specified how the role is going to look like based on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/what-s-next-for-volunteer-leadership-in-2018-shared-agreements/25091">the agreements the Mission Driven Mozillians group has crafted</a>.</p>

Where people hold coordinating roles, they should be reviewed regularly
<ul>
<li>This creates opportunities for new, diverse leaders to emerge.</li>
<li>Ensures continuous support from the communities they serve.</li>
<li>Prevents toxic individuals from maintaining power indefinitely.</li>
<li>Allows space for individuals to receive feedback and support to better thrive in their role.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>What does that mean for Community Experts?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>All Community experts and any volunteers that hold roles within this group have fixed terms and are reviewed regularly. Established processes will help contributors give feedback and review these roles.</li>
</ul>

Responsibilities should be clearly communicated and distributed
<ul>
<li>Creates more opportunities for more people.</li>
<li>Avoids gatekeeping and power accumulation.</li>
<li>Reduces burnout and over reliance on an individual by sharing accountability.</li>
<li>Creates leadership pathways for new people.</li>
<li>Potentially increases diversity.</li>
<li>An emphasis on responsibility over title avoids unnecessary “authority labels”.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>What does that mean for the Community Experts?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>All Community experts have public role descriptions that articulate clearly their responsibilities and have a culture of delegating them when needed across their co-volunteers.</li>
</ul>

When people are in a coordinating role, they should abide by standards, and be accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities
<ul>
<li>This builds confidence and support for individuals and these roles from community members and staff.</li>
<li>Ensures that everyone has shared clarity on expectations and success.</li>
<li>Creates an environment where the CPG is applied consistently.</li>
<li>Increases the consistency in roles across the organization .</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>What does that mean for the Community Experts?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>All Community experts should keep their activities public and visible to everyone and they are accountable to fulfill their responsibilities</li>
</ul>

People in coordinating roles should follow and model Mozilla’s diversity &amp; inclusion values
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a culture of inclusion that invites participation from new voices.</li>
<li>Encourages the inclusion of diverse voices and groups.</li>
<li>Creates an environment where the CPG is applied consistently.</li>
<li>Enables leadership pathways that explicitly consider inclusion dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>What does that mean for the Community Experts?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Community experts group has processes that are optimized to be welcoming to diverse audiences, ensures that all community building activities across the organization roles are available for everyone, and has communication channels that are properly used and are accessible for everyone. All Community experts are trained on the  CPG before joining and are confident to flag any lack of accountability and/or violations of the CPG.</li>
</ul>

People with coordinating roles should be supported and recognized in a set of standard ways across Mozilla
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Enables people to have equal access to training and growth opportunities regardless of what part of the organisation they contribute to.</li>
<li>Allows people to follow their passions/skills instead of just contribute for rewards.</li>
<li>Roles have clear definitions and avoid labels that create authority feeling</li>
<li>We get shared understandings of the kind of responsibilities that exist</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>What does that mean for the Community Experts?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>This means that we recognize all community building activities across the organization equally, support and also provide training for skills improvement on community building and self development.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>These are the agreements that the Reps Council is suggesting and we need your feedback!</p>
<p>All Reps should agree because of their role as a community coordinators in their communities, let us know what you think on <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/community-coordinator-role-is-here/32485">Discourse</a>!</p>

                    <p><strong>DevConf.in 2018</strong> is the second annual Developers’ Conference to be organized by Red Hat in Bengaluru, India. It is meant to provide a platform to the local FOSS community participants to come together and engage in the knowledge sharing through technical talks, workshops, panel discussions, hackathon, and such activities.</p>
<p>More about my talk and conference can be found <a href="https://github.com/rowdymehul/devconfIN">here</a>;</p>
<p>Our goal is to promote and educate people about authentication &amp; authorization. Also, learn about the different concepts JS and how that make up an application secure.</p>
<p>As usual this time also, at end moment I’ve decided to attend this conference and since this conference is organized by <strong>Red Hat</strong> so I was quite excited to speak here. <strong>DevConf</strong> first time happening in India. This conference originally started on <strong>10 September 2009</strong>, this was the first ever conference organized by <strong>Red Hat Czech Republic</strong> in the <strong>Czech Republic</strong> and the rest is history.<span id="more-1634"></span></p>
<p>Due to flight delayed I reached the hotel late at night and was too tired but there some points left to add in the presentation. I was actually preparing some demos which I wanted to demonstrate to participants. Even after so much tired the energy level was same, thanks to Red Bull as well to keep me awake. </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1635" style="width: 1546px;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.rowdymehul.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DiBMjZoWsAY3ZNq.jpglarge.jpeg"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Picture Credits: Viral Parmar</p></div>
<p>I have talked on “<strong>JS Authentication with Auth0</strong>“. This was introductory talk about the JS Authentication, where we have discussed the role that Auth0 authentication plays in modern software development where it is a lot more than just the login screen.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>First, we gave a bit of background that Authentication and Authorization are two different processes. This time Viral Parmar who is a cybersecurity expert in his region join me for this session and shared some great trips to about online security.</p>
<p>I ’ve already discovered <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>, an Authentication as a Service. Using their JavaScript SDK you can able to offer social logins using Github, Facebook and much more from the web interface. At the time of writing it’s free for up to 7000 registered users and they offer a nice web interface to manage all users who signed up / logged in. More you can explore from <a href="https://auth0.com/opensource">here</a>;</p>
We have also covered the following points in the talk;
<ul>
<li>web security <span class="module__title__link">Vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li>Passwordless authentication</li>
<li>SSO</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://auth0.com/opensource">Auth0</a> as authentication</li>
<li>Brute force <span class="module__title__link">attack</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk, we have received so many questions but mostly on <strong>SSO</strong> as participants are quite curious to know more about. Some were working professionals and there were asking about how they implement <strong>SSO</strong> on their business set up so all an all it was quite a healthy discussion. Some questions we have answered them after wrap up and over a cup of coffee in break session.</p>
<p>Also, while walking to booth sections got a chance to interact with many participants from the conference, some were known faces who attended our talk and some came up with new questions. This is the best part of being in the community where you will get a chance to exchange your knowledge and you always go back home with some new learning or experience.</p>

<p><strong>Dates of the event: 04 &amp; 05, August, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue : Christ University, Bangalore, India.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the first conference as a speaker I attended and it turned out to be a great event with huge bunch of people interested in tech and only tech (I like this kind of community basically). The whole space around me was filled with chit-chats on technology, discussions about programming and fresh Open Source ideas. The decorum was well maintained with debates and discussions in workshops and speaker sessions, ultimately a lot of ideas shared. So, all  this can happen only in this interesting arena called “Devconf”.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Devconf 2018- India, is the second annual meetup organised by Redhat and one of the massive events for all the like minded tech savvy people under one roof. It was a 2-day conference and the first day the intensity of the summit was elevated with the keynote session by Ric Wheeler on his journey in Open Source. I went around for other talks and also was part of the Mozilla Booth where my contributions on WebVR were displayed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the evening the most awaited part happened, I delivered my talk under the title : “Behind the screen: WebXR revealed”. It was very interesting to have assorted age group people and they were interested to learn more about what is Virtual/Augmented/ Mixed Reality. I demonstrated a few samples on how I used A-frame to create different VR/AR scenes. The best part is I had many people who spoke with me after the talk and how they very curious to go about this. Happened to meet much experienced audience from giant industries too and they discussed with me on how this technology can be of great help to improve their organisations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The second day was kick started with the keynote session by Christian Heimes, who spoke on security and efficient encryption techniques. I was fortunate to meet him in person on his visit to the Booth area and explained about the products we worked on. Definitely, he’s a man of good humane and is constantly in touch with me and eager enough to know more about my interest on AR/VR.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These two days I enjoyed as it was like more of a carnival and this was a great opportunity to meet a lot of my fellow Mozillians. A lot of whom I was contacting virtually so I little struggled to recognise them    However, the multifacet community I had ever seen and always vibrant , so very proud a Mozillian.</p>

This is the 2nd time happening at India, it was one of the amazing open source event I attended recently.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two months back CFP was released, as soon as I came to know about it applied for Mozilla Community booth, personally there was call from inside to apply for this meetup. We were very lucky our Mozilla community got opportunity to present various contribution areas at devconf, which is mostly dedicated to developers. And Priyanka shared about this in Mozilla India community mailing list.</p>
<p>This time MozillaIN community had Amazing booth where our focus is to share about <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aframe</a> , <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust Language</a> , <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebExtension</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Before Meetup, one of the first task is to bring design for Booth, our theme was based on Rust, Firefox Family (&amp; Webextesion), Aframe, we gave this requirements to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/issues/215" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mozilla Open Design</a> team, and one of contributor from India Tanzeel Khan brought the beautiful design (above one). But due to some issues were not  able to print this, but in the large LCD TV we showed this majestic poster during break (when we are not showing demo).</p>
<p>Second major task was to bring pull contributors who are going to speak at various sessions and also volunteers who can be at booth. Our plan is to make sure minimum 3 are present at any moment  at booth. At first invited Ramdayal, Abhiram and other speakers, they brought in huge number of other Mozillians who will participate.</p>

<p>The Day 1 started with amazing show by Christ University students. Then Ric Wheeler started Keynote <strong>“Open source is better for companies/businesses, communities and developers”</strong> of Devconf. Once Keynote is done, we (Ram dayal, Bhuvana and myself) started towards Exhibition area to setup up Mozilla booth. It was start of the day, there were already many open source booth setup by other communities ( Elastic, FSMK, devopedia , Openshift and so on..).</p>
<p>Soon we setup the Mozilla Booth, large number of attendees started joining us. Soon Abhiram joined us to help and share about Rust Language. He started to share about Rust and also about his Amazing rust series which is available in lynda.com for 1 month trial.

<p>At the mean time, on another side Ramdayal was sharing his experience about WebVR.  Rakhi was sharing about Mozilla Contribution in general, I was setting up with the Code demo for WebExtension.  Bhuvana was helping me to setup her <a href="https://bhuvanameenakshik.github.io/Pongal_WebVR_wishes/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebVR demo</a> , old but we can use this to explain about Aframe simply.</p>
<p>After their session <a href="https://twitter.com/rowdymehul" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mehul Patel</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/viralparmarhack" rel="nofollow">Viral Parmar</a>  came to Mozilla booth and sharing their knowledge about Rust and Privacy. Our Swag superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/pathfinderpc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prathamesh Chavan</a> traveled from Pune to Bangalore, and without taking any break he reached venue ( remember Bangalore airport to Venue will take around an hour).</p>

<p></p>
<p>Around 5:30 PM we all Mozillians left after having some casual talks like what we are going to focus on future, and exchanged lot of interesting ideas. Around 750+ members might have joined us at booth.</p>
<p>Second day started at 9:00 AM as usual. We made sure no one is waiting for us. The crowd was comparatively less at the morning as we had Keynote starting.</p>
<p>We are joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/jyotsna17gupta" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jyotsna Gupta</a> , Lavish , <a href="https://twitter.com/TushkiSpeaks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tushar Arora</a> , Abraar Syed , pooja and many others (sorry forgetting the names).

<p></p>
<p>On Second Day evening I was fortune to meet Deb, one of the long time Mozillian who was looked like Coding God for community members from Mozilla India, he is one of the greatest Mozillian I have met.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We tried to capture some of group pictures, for sure some contributors who actively were in booth or giving talks are missing in pictures.</p>

                    <h6>mkohler on August 10, 2018 09:18 AM</h6>
                    <div class="cooked">
<p>Please join us in congratulating <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Liv/" rel="nofollow noopener">Lívia Takács</a>, our Rep of the Month for July 2018!</p>
<p>Livia is a UI developer and visual designer from Hungary and has been part of the Reps program for a bit more than a year. In that time she organized a lot of events with different communities (like LibreOffice) and also workshops.</p>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper">
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://discourse-paas-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/2/42d28bad219b632f3736b0dbd9e03318e4f20bdf.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener" title="99327b7dc22fc651f4019467a59b0cbb.jpg"></a></p>
<div class="meta"><span class="informations"> </span></div>
</div>
<p>She also organizes Mozilla Hungary community meetings and a few months ago she organized the <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/firefox-support-sprint-5/" rel="nofollow noopener">Firefox Support Sprint</a> in Budapest.</p>
<p>She is a mentor and teacher at specific workshops where she teaches JavaScript and localization, such as <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozskool-4/" rel="nofollow noopener">MozSkool</a> teaching JavaScript to 15-18 years old girls and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozscope-workshop-5/" rel="nofollow noopener">MozScope</a> localization workshops. This is a great example that a community builder can organize events but also mentor and teach new people to help growing the local community.</p>
<p>Thanks Lívia, keep rocking the Open Web!  </p>

                  <h5>Reps Council at SF All Hands 2018</h5>
                    <h6>kpapadea on July 20, 2018 12:39 PM</h6>
                    <p><em>This post was written by <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh Chavan</a></em></p>
<p><b>TL;DR</b></p>
<p><i>The All Hands is a special time of the year where Mozilla employees along with core volunteers gather for a week of many meetings and brainstorming. The</i><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco"><i> All Hands Wiki page</i></a><i> has more information about the general setting. During the All Hands, the Reps Council participated in the Open Innovation meetings as well as had meetings about improve 2018 planning. </i></p>
<p>The Mozilla All-Hands was organized between 11th June to 15th June 2018 in San Francisco. All Hands are a unique and special opportunity for all paid staff and our most impactful volunteers to come together, in person, to share experiences and interact with people they may not normally work with.</p>
<p>This year’s All Hands was a great learning experience for the Reps Council and Peers.</p>
<p>The Reps Council worked more on the projects which could directly or indirectly help the community and align the plan for the community for the next quarters.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we made was a little recap of what we have done in the first half:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/reps_council.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The Reps Council members were invited to join the different meetings which were focused on Localization of Firefox, the Addon sprint campaigns to define the final plan and Diversity &amp; Inclusion.</p>
<p>The status of Mission Driven Mozillians and the Mozilla Group experiment in India was also shared with the Reps Council. The Reps Council was very interested to understand how the program can fit in and align itself with the new opportunities.</p>
<p>The Reps Council also ran a check on the issues opened in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues">https://github.com/mozilla/reps/issues</a> and assigned tasks on the issues which were pending or open since a while.</p>
<p>The Reps Council and Peers discussed some of the important things which are as follows :</p>
<p>– Achievements in the past quarter</p>
<p>– Mozilla Reps Logo</p>
<p>– Mozilla Reps Newsletter team</p>
<p>– Prioritize tickets for the Reps Portal</p>
<p>– Collecting ideas about data gathering to enable data-driven decisions</p>
<p>– Issues on priorities</p>
<p>– Failure and Success of the Reps program</p>
<p>– Mission Driven Mozillians</p>
<p>– H2 plan</p>
<p>There was a meeting on the H2 plan to discuss and assign priorities. A blogpost about this plan would be shared soon.</p>
<p>The Open Innovation Team shared the numbers of the Sprints of this half of the year where there was an huge involvement of our Reps and communities.</p>
<p>The All Hands was quite productive for the Reps Council and the things which were discussed would start be getting reflected in the present quarter (July, August, September).</p>

                  <h5>In loving memory of Abbackar DIOMANDE</h5>
                    <h6>kpapadea on July 18, 2018 12:35 PM</h6>
                    <p>It brings us great sadness to share with you the recent news about one of our dear Rep we will so fondly remember. Abbackar DIOMANDE from Ivory Coast is unfortunately no longer with us.</p>
<p>Diomande, was a Mozillian from Bouake, Ivory Coast and was contributing in various Mozilla projects including SUMO and L10n.<br />
He was a local community builder, that helped to build a healthy local community in his country while lately he had also taken the role of a Resources Rep, helping his fellow Mozillians on organizing local initiatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/files/2018/07/diomande.jpg"></a><br />
His passing is finding us sadden and shocked. His contributions helped our community intensively and while we have a heavy heart, we know that his passion and inspiration will sustain with us.</p>
<p>Our condolences to his family and friends.</p>
<p><b>Bellow are some words about Diomande and his work from his community members in French</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Puisse Dieu t’accueillir dans son royaume Diomande. Mes Condoléances à toute la famille.</p>
<p>Diomandé a été un de mes meilleurs mentorés, il a aimé et est toujours resté fan de Mozilla , avec le coeur il a su toujours selon sa façon conduire sa passion pour Mozilla.<br />
Tu n’a pas souffert, que la terre te soit légère et tu puisse trouver la paix. Repose en paix Diomandé.<br />
Mes condoléances à toute ta famille, tes amis qui t’aimaient et toute la famille Mozilla.</p>
<p>Rip Cher ami , le passage est obligatoire , Puisse Dieu te reserver un acceuille céleste digne de tes apports volontaires , Mozillians from Pigier</p>
<p>Courage, oui grand courage à la famille, un genie ne meurt jamais. Abbackar n’est pas mort, il nous attend juste de l’autre côté de la rive. Abbackar n’est pas mort, Abbackar vivra toujours.</p>
<p>Diomandé été un des contributeur de Mozilla, à travers tous ses ateliers ou actions menées pour la communauté, ses traces resterons à jamais, elles continueront de parler de lui. Je retiens à lui, un grand homme plein de valeurs, son époque sera marqué par des traces indélibiles. ( Wilfried N’Guessan )</p>
<p>Diomandé était un bosseur, un battant qui a aimé trop le développement d’applications. Il a proposé des solutions innovantes . Mes respects pour chaque bonne action qu’il a fait pour ce monde. (Ange Bagui)</p>
<p>Un MozBoy est pati. Un arbuste qui avait toutes les aptitudes pour devenir une grande arbre avec de grande branches et un gros spectre d’ombre. La communauté a perdu un véritable passionné. YAKO A TOUS !!!</p>
<p>Cher ami, c’est avec les larmes aux yeux et une grande tristesse que je redige cette note. Tu vas nous manquer!</p></blockquote>

                  <h5>H2 2018 Reps Plan for the Council</h5>
                    <h6>kpapadea on July 16, 2018 02:34 PM</h6>
                    <p><em>This blogpost was authored by </em><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Mte90/"><em>Daniele Scasciafratte</em></a></p>
What we have done
<p>In the first half of the year, our focus was to align the program with <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/tags/mission-mozillians">Mission Driven Mozillians</a> and prepare the mandatory Reps onboarding course to ensure it aligns with the D&amp;I work. We have also started improving the understanding of issues of different Reps roles like Mentors and Alumni.</p>
<p>We also worked on administration issues like the transition of inactive Reps to Alumni, the cleanup of old Reps applications still open after years and wrong mentors assigned to profiles and the improvement of our reporting system. Last but not least, we moved to the creation of expertise teams that took over everyday work day tasks from the Council (newsletter and onboarding).</p>
<p>We’ve chosen to split our ideas and tasks in 3 different areas for the next half of the year (with percentage):</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians: 45%</li>
<li>Visible wins: 45%</li>
<li>Miscellaneous: 10%</li>
</ul>
Prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians
<p>The Reps program is working to prepare the ground for Mission Driven Mozillians and there are different tasks and issues to face for that.</p>
<p>The most important point for the Reps Council is the Roles of Reps inside the communities. We know that in Mozilla there are a lot of international communities, local community and project specific communities, and we need to understand and be ready to support all of them.</p>
<p>We gathered different ideas that we will investigate soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Role of Reps
<ul>
<li>Update all the Reps about the last updates of the Mission Driven Mozillians program
<ul>
<li>Understanding and agreement on Leadership Agreement</li>
<li>Start conversations on where Reps belong/Reps Role</li>
<li>We are already working on:
<ul>
<li>Restart Newsletter with a new team</li>
<li>Discussion about migrating the Reps mailing list to Discourse</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create courses for various roles
<ul>
<li>Review Team and Mentors already have a course</li>
<li>We are working on a new onboarding course</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skills criteria for various roles
<ul>
<li>Every role has a skillset and we are working to improve them as requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mozilla Groups (MDM)
<ul>
<li>How they fit inside the Reps program
<ul>
<li>This is an experiment and we need to understand how the program can fit to be part of this initiative</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Onboarding
<ul>
<li>New SOPs for various roles/teams
<ul>
<li>We updated SOPs in the past and we need to define where we need to update them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courses inside the program
<ul>
<li>Few roles have courses but for Reps we need to define if we can do general courses or if we can find them already available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPG Alignment (update the Reps with updated CPG information, add it as mandatory part to the onboarding course)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Visible wins
<p>The program also needs to be more visible inside Mozilla and the others communities, so we’ve chosen to focus on 3 different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication
<ul>
<li>Discover new areas where Reps are missing
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of communities where we don’t have a large representation or there is no interest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reps news to all Mozilla
<ul>
<li>Share what Reps are doing, for example during the Weekly Monday Project Call</li>
</ul>

Miscellaneous
<p>The last area that we chose are the miscellaneous ideas, something that does not block the program’s goals but can improve it, at the same time this has low priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving mentee/mentors relationship</li>
<li>Improving understanding of Alumni role</li>
<li>Improve reps-tweet social usage</li>
<li>Style guidelines for the community</li>
<li>Reporting activities

<li>Without reports it’s difficult to do data-driven decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand issues Reps face with reporting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of ideas will be evaluated in the next quarters by the Council and as usual we are open to feedback!</p>

                  <h5>LinuxCon China</h5>
                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on July 05, 2018 04:43 AM</h6>
                    <p>LinuxCon China was a technical conference for developers, operations experts (architects, sys admins, devops), business, compliance and legal leadership and other professionals to come together in an informal setting to learn from open source experts, have fascinating discussions, collaborate with peers, and gain a competitive advantage with innovative open solutions.</p>
<p>This year I got an opportunity to talk about and represent Auth0 and Mozilla at LinuxCon. It was a 3-day conference where My first talk was based on Serverless where I was representing Auth0 and next day I was representing Mozilla with A-frame and WebVR theme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first day was really amazing as I had to visit all the sponsor’s booth where I got swags and most importantly networking. My talk on Serverless was at 16:20 Chinese Time. It was wonderful to see many attendees waiting for the talk, I started the <a href="https://slides.com/mdsbzalam/lc3-china/">presentation</a> where I discussed the basics of Client-Server architecture and why we need security layer and how one can get started with serverless. The response of the talk was really good as many came after the session for the get started link and to clear their doubts. It was a good day at the conference.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/linuxcon-china/img_20180626_140732/"></a>

<p>The second day, I had an open session at the CNCC, where I was given a space where attendees came to interact and know about the project. The project I was having was of A-frame and WebVR. It was really fun to interact with the Chinese attendees as many were unable to understand or speak English, so I had to use VPN to use Google Translate( good translation  ). Many were excited to know about A-frame since it requires a very little amount of background in computer science to get started. I have shared the links with them via email and wechat. It was a good day to conclude the conference and very happy to represent both Mozilla and Auth0.</p>

                  <h5>Taking WebXR to the most energetic gen</h5>
                    <h6>bhuvanameenakshi on May 29, 2018 10:20 AM</h6>
                    <p><strong>Venue: Academic heights public school, Hyderabad</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 20.05.2018</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I in the first place wondered whether a topic like WebXR going to complicate the audience I targeted for the day. My audience included 50+ kids, their parents and their guardians of the AHP school. But when I showed the crowd the VR googles and asked the question what is it and what does that deal with, I got answers from 5 kids. With no doubt the kids were familiar with Virtual Reality as they had played games in malls and game arcades in their city. Also they were familiar with Augmented Reality as they had played Pokemon Go in their mobile phones. This eventually made my job easy.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I amused them with the fusing results of AR and VR and how this can lead to WebXR. They loved experimenting with the VR googles. They in fact gave solutions on how their education system can be improvised with technologies like these. It was very much vibrant to see these kids who wanted to make their classrooms more interesting.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon session was mainly focussed for parents and guardians. I emphasised on why this gen must be involved in learning latest technology. Also in most parts of India after a girl child finishes her studies, about 70-80% percent are married at an earlier age (that is before they getting an industry ot real technology exposure), so application of knowledge is very less. To overcome this I shared ideas and motivated the parents to allow their girls to freely explore what they need in life in terms of technology or any other innovation. Furthermore, I took myself as an example and told them my journey and how I got into Mozilla and also how Mozilla helps its women contributors through its Womoz program.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final touch as usual, no matter whatever the age group my audience fall into, they always love the swags from Mozilla.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a closing note, I thank AHP school, Hyderabad for inviting me as a speaker for their Summer School progam 2018. Also my humblest gratitude to Mozilla and Shahbaz (my Reps mentor) for always encouraging me to participate in these wonderful events.</p>

                  <h5>Organise things right!</h5>
                    <h6>bhuvanameenakshi on May 15, 2018 05:31 AM</h6>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Global Sprint which was going throughout the world on various projects made Fahima and me to think about the event in our home town too. So I took the initiative to organise all things required for this event. I thought this way I would also learn a lot on event organisation and hosting.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had 15+ participants who actively took part in this event. The event was focussed on SOHW(Spread Open Healthy Web) project and explained in what ways the participants can do their part in this project.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this project we had various issues and its main objective was to be a single point of access to the resources thus helping the newbies to start their contributions. The issue had various interesting topics like making memes, designing logo and also many stuffs related to building the webpage for this particular project. Eventually, there were many options to contribute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the afternoon, we attended the global online conference call where everyone got an opportunity to speak about their projects. It was indeed amazing to see other projects happening world-wide. Found that this sprint was indeed spread across miles and had a great impact in relevant to current technologies and open source.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we concluded the event with some feedback from the participants and also distributed the swags. We are very much grateful Smt. Sujatha, Principal, Sai Bhuvaneswari Vidyalaya N&amp;P school, for sponsoring a beautiful venue. The event was a great success and also we had contributors to this project from overseas where they worked in remote.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks Mozilla for giving us this wonderful opportunity and swags </p>

                    <h6>Vitchu on April 27, 2018 11:00 PM</h6>
                    <p>This is my second visit to Pune, after my recent <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//GNUNify_18">GNUify</a> event. GNUNify was mainly focused for Student developers, the target audience were getting started with Open source community. COeP Foss Meetup had well experienced developers and students who are contributing for FOSS community more than 1 year. Abhijit who is the professor at COEP and helping lot of students to get started with community. He is an amazing person I meet, who came forward to share his thoughts about my presentation and spends time with students and motivates them a lot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The hall was really big filled with 200 attendees. Energy was really good and I was really excited to give the presentation. For this presentation I have been showing the demo with Commands API and tabs.ExecuteScript API. The internet was really slow during my presentation, due to this therewas some breakage in the flow. Abhijit Sir, came forward to share his Mobile internet and I was able to show the demo of my Youtube Extension.</p>
<p>Some of the questions came around the Chrome Compatibility, and one of the long time Mozillian Friend Ankit gave suggestions in improving the Extensions which is used for demo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After my session we had amazing session by Kushal Das on SecureDrop. Then we had a session by Rahulkrishnan on Docker.</p>
<p>After the session we had a small Tea break session, where contributors from various projects came and had informal discussion. Some of the contributors who tried to become Mozilla Reps or tried to contribute to various projects shared the pros and cons in community.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to Ankit home and meet his family, had a very good tea time with them. After that we went to the near by mall and tried some amazing local food.</p>
<p>I personally felt this is amazing Meetup I have been. I really felt bad I didnt plan to attend the second day of the event. In upcoming years I will make sure to give talk on this Meetup. Personal thanks to Vikrant (student from coep), who was with me for the whole day.</p>

                  <h5>WebVR @ LPU</h5>
                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on April 27, 2018 05:59 AM</h6>
                    <p>Lovely Professional University is a private university situated in Jalandhar, Punjab, India. It is a well know educational institutions in the country with around 34000 students and over 130 programs. Mrinal and I were invited to LPU for a workshop on WebVR ( Virtual Reality ). We reached LPU on 17th April and visited the campus.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1075" style="width: 798px;"><p class="wp-caption-text">The morning started with a good cup of tea</p></div>
<p>We reached the auditorium on time. And yes it was filled with 1300 students. One of the biggest auditorium I have seen till now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event started with a brief introduction of speakers and then I started the explaining the difference between Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. Also Why we need these technologies?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Started with the Aframe Presentation slide to explain the basics of WebVR and A-frame. Students were really interested to know more about it.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/webvr-lpu/dsc_0011/"></a>

<p>After a while, students were getting bored, so I started with Virtual Girlfriend story ( Prathamesh’s story it is ) to explain the difference of VR, AR, and MR. And what all application we can build and solve real problems.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>The event was really good, students asked many questions related to Mozilla, it’s product and Open Source in general. Would love to visit again </p>

                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on April 09, 2018 06:25 PM</h6>
                    <p>Again trio has come together for a wonderful event. This time it was IIT-BHU. The event started with the introduction of the speakers, Shahbaz, Umesh and Prathamesh ( trio aka SUP ). Prathamesh started the session explaining the difference between VR, AR, and MR. People were amazed to know that they will be creating their VR experience after the brief presentation.</p>
<p>After Prathamesh, I talked about basics of WebVR and how easy it is to build in just a few lines of codes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The hacking began with remixing Hello World example on glitch.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’ll be using more pics to describe what happened in the event.</p>

<p><strong>Date: 24<sup>th</sup> March,2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue: SRM University, Chennai</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day started with the inauguration by the chief guest, Mr. Raaman. It was an interesting talk on Linux forum and how open source plays the real trend in today’s world. I was very glad and proud to be amidst of great speakers who were very much senior to me in age and also in experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My session happened in the second half slot and I initially gave a small pitching about my talk and audience who were interested to know more took part in my session. Surprisingly, I had 50+ enthusiastic audiences who were very keen to know the tricks and magic hidden in WebXR. I shared my in detail on how WebXR works followed by definitions on WebVR, WebAR and WebMR. Furthermore, I amused my participants with my demos and gave them an idea on how this technology can be used in real time for useful applications. Moreover, I shared about the WebVR Challenge and how to approach the same.</p>

                  <h5>Virtual Reality @ Hackfest, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad</h5>
                    <h6>Md Shahbaz Alam on March 28, 2018 03:15 PM</h6>
                    <p>HackFest is IIT(ISM) Dhanbad’s 36-hour annual hackathon organized by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) and ACM Student Chapter, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.</p>
<p>The event started with an introduction of speakers. <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh</a>, <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/umesh/">Umesh</a>, and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahbaz/">Shahbaz</a> ( yep it’s me ), since we had limited time with us. So it was a quick talk-demo-workshop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prathamesh started with his favorite virtual girlfriend story to explain the concept of  Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. After a long and tiring hackathon, the audience seems interested and was into it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I talked about the basics of WebVR, why we brought the VR on Web and what are their advantages. Used Kevin’s presentation for explaining the concept in details with his amazing presentation (<a href="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/" rel="nofollow">https://aframevr.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining what WebVR is, we asked participants to visit <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="nofollow">https://aframe.io/</a> and remix the hello world example on  <a href="http://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://glitch.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>Due to the limited amount of time, participants couldn’t finish their idea. So we gave them a contest, where top 5 scenes will get a surprise gift from us.</p>
<p>And here comes, what we love most. After event photograph with the participants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will be seen together soon in IIT-BHU.</p>

                    <p>WebMR is a new technology which is in its initial stages. WebMR was the thing which has brought a huge participation at Baroda.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly waiting for us. Event started with a brief introduction of the speakers. Prathamesh Chavan and I talked about our love to open source.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_103016_bokeh/"></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_095537/"></a>

<p>Prathamesh talked about the differences of WebVR WebAR and WebMR. His way of relating things to virtual girlfriend has brought a new spark in attendees.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I talked about basics of Virtual reality and why we have brought the VR on Web. And how easy it is to code and experience the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br />
<br />
Lunch time, we went to Nosh Farmaiye, best place in town for chicken kebabs. Must place to visit when you’re in town.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the lunch we started the hand-on session of WebVR . And to do so nothing is better than a hello world example. We have used glitch to live demo the scenes.</p>
<p>First day concluded with the prize distribution to the top 5 teams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Second day started with WebAR, I explained the differences and similarities in AR and VR. Here again started with hello world example using hero marker.<br />
And talked about new features of AR and VR.</p>

<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_160339/"></a>
<a href="https://alamshahbaz.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/footprints-2018/img_20180224_142250/"></a>

<p>Definitely one day we would do a full session on WebMR.</p>

                  <h5>My first talk on WebXR</h5>
                    <h6>bhuvanameenakshi on March 18, 2018 05:12 PM</h6>
                    <p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Date: 17.03.2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue : PES University, Bangalore, India.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was my first presentation on WebXR as my previous talks were mostly focused on WebVR and projects related to it. There were around 150+ enthusiastic participants who actively participated in this event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The morning first half session, I briefed about Mozilla and its projects. As the students haven’t come across Mozilla rather than its Firefox browser, I got this platform to rightly propagate about the community and how they can involve themselves in volunteer contributions both as individual and as an institution.  I mainly emphasized on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add-ons/ Webextensions</li>
<li>Localisation</li>
<li>SuMo</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>WebVR</li>
<li>Mozilla Mixed reality</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forenoon second half session involved a deep dive into WebXR. I found the audience struck with surprise on how technology has rapidly grown and how Mozilla is also into the competition.  After giving a detailed notion on WebXR I showed a few demos on my contributions to WebVR and WebAR.</p>

<p></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the intervals the students got a chance to experience Virtual Reality world using VR googles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a feedback form to be filled by my audience and based on this I was about to predict the count of participants for my afternoon session. To my surprise almost 80% of the attendees came forward for the hands-on session.</p>

<p></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I initially helped with two different Hello World programs using A-frame. Later I hosted a mini hackathon that is, to create a WebVR or WebAR application on either “<strong>Informative Pokemon world</strong>” or “<strong>Press for Progress-International Women’s day 2018</strong>”.  Almost everyone gave a very unique try and within 30 minutes they were competing enthusiastically. Finally, I got the tiresome task of choosing the winner of the contest and I appreciated them with A-frame T-shirts. The students were indeed glad to take away the swags and were contented for the time they had invested.</p>

                  <h5>International Women's Day with WoMoz in Delhi</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on March 14, 2018 09:21 PM</h6>
                    <p>We all know that every year, 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day. It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights. On this occasion, all the Open Source communities in and around Delhi came forward to hold a mega-meetup to encourage more women to take active part in Open Source &amp; Tech on March 10, 2018.</p>
<p>We were astonished to see the huge turn around of 180 people including 150+ women participants.</p>

<p>Mozilla Delhi, PyDelhi, PyLadies Delhi, LinuxChix India, Women Who Code Delhi, Women Who Go Delhi, Women Techmakers Delhi, and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science were the communities helped up in shaping the event.</p>
<p>Here are some of the volunteers who helped to make the event possible</p>

<p>We had 3 main technical talks which were all presented by Women having a decade of experience working in the technical field. Apart from that, we had several other lightening talks and community talks.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/a2batic">Kanika</a> gave a lightening talk on "WoMoz" &amp; encouraged students to contribute to Mozilla.</p>

<p>Later, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">I got a chance to</a> give a lightening talk on "Why you should contribute to Open Source", to help &amp; encourage folks to contribute to Open Source projects.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who helped with the event &amp; Adobe for sponsoring the venue. Don't forget to join the Open Source groups in &amp; around Delhi that you're interested in. As always, if you need any help on contributing, drop me a mail at Sanyam [at] SanyamKhurana [dot] com.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://makerfest.com">Makerfest</a> has been a place to explore and learn from all the makers and collaborators. This is my 2nd consecutive year as Volunteer from Mozilla India. This time I was there to represent Auth0 and talk about its service.</p>
<p>I joined the Mozilla booth for the WebVR session, a joint session taken by <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/">Prathamesh</a> and me. We talked about the Virtual Reality on Web and played with the sample codes. Not to forget the VR experience provided to the attendees.</p>

                    <h6>Vitchu on March 05, 2018 11:00 PM</h6>
                    <p>Prayatna is one of the prime Technical fest organised by MIT, Anna University Chennai. It is an yearly where the number of students participating will be very high.</p>
<p>This year our community organized One day workshop of WebExtension. This time Balaji who developed amazing Add-ons previously and student from SRM University came forward to give session about his Add-ons and the WebExtension API he has used.</p>
<p>We started the session at 10:30 AM. First I gave talk on what are the different areas of Contribution where students can focus and which will be helpful to imrpove their professional skill set. Then I was giving the introduction of WebExtension.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By afternoon we gave a general introduction about what is WexExtension. After the lunch session Balaji started explaning his WebExtension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-editor/?src=search">Live Editor</a></p>
<p>After that we went for small Hands-on Session.  In this session we were using Commands API to build our own custom commands.</p>
<p>Around 50+ students attended the session. Around 30+ received the follow up Email. It was one of the diverse group of students. Students across tamilnadu came. The reach about Mozilla community is good and many were interested to know about FSA program.</p>

                  <h5>KGiSL Mozactivate 2018</h5>
                    <h6>Vitchu on March 02, 2018 11:00 PM</h6>
                    <p>KGiSL community space is very close to every Mozillian around Tamilnadu, we had our first meetup there. There are lot of events related to Mozilla and open source communities happen at this space. After so long time I got opportunity to come to this space and share my knowledge about the WebExtension.</p>
<p>For this event, I personally started training 6 students before the event. My main goal is to make sure they are in good position to explore more about WebExtensions and answer the questions which are asked by their friends during session. It is like Train the trainers. We in Mozilla India community are doing great job by developing many WebExtensions but at the same time the number of trainers are less and it started increasing slowly in past few days.</p>
<p>On the event day around 35 students appeared, the attendence was very less due to the Job Fair  happening in the city all of the sudden. Till Friday evening there were good amount of registration but sudden announcement of Job fair made Final year and Third year students to go there. They are the main audience of the session. But some of them turned up.</p>
<p>During this session I was discussing about ContextMenu, as the students will be more interested to hack them compared to any other API. The students present were able to grasp the knowledge very quickly. One of the interesting thing happned to me for the first time is, I have to work without computer; yes on that day I was using the Black board to teach students and this is the first time I am doing it. Explaining using Black board was very interesting and I was very happy to do it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was excited to know two of the attendees developed their extension and pushed them to AMO.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ShankarDhandapani/WebExtensions">Translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-selection/">Search</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mozillatn.github.io/KiTE/blog/KGISL-ADDON-Hack">Blog post by KGiSL club</a></p>
<p>Most intersting and must needed part is, Sriram created Video about his extension, how he developed and explained his code, how to run it in browser. This is one of the great job done. I used to suggest many students about this, and Many techspeakers are now focusing on creating video tutorials, thanks to Sriram as he started at this early time.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>In future I will be collobrating with this students and planning to continue creating more vidoes about WebExtensions.  This will be really helpful and we can bring more students as TechSpeakers in future.</p>

                  <h5>MozAMU: Mozilla Addons Development at AMU</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on March 01, 2018 11:41 AM</h6>
                    <p>It all started with PyCon India. I met a few students of Aligarh Muslim University who were trying to teach about FOSS in their college. A few them were already contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">Coala</a>. We talked a bit and they were discussing problems they were facing to run that community. I already started a Mozilla community at my college in the earlier days. Since I brought up a lot of folks from my college community in the event, we together discussed <em>How to nurture FOSS communities in college</em> as part of PyCon India Open Spaces. Here is a glimpse of the same:</p>

<p>Later, these folks were excited and invited me as a speaker at their college. A lot of planning happened for the event and we were in touch almost daily for different things. We planned the event one and a half month in advance. Finally, on 24th Feb 2018, we decided to have a full-day event around FOSS at Aligarh Muslim University.</p>
<p>We left from Delhi at around 6:30 AM in the morning. We then halted at a cafe known as <cite>Break Point</cite> around Aligarh to have breakfast. We reached the university at around 10:20 AM.</p>
<p>We took some time to test the entire set-up and the event began at around 11:30 AM. I took the first session on <strong>Why you should contribute to Open Source</strong>. We discussed the question that somehow pops up sooner or later into everyone's mind while contributing to Open Source: <strong>What's in it for me?</strong>.</p>
<p>We discussed various pathways one can begin contributing to Open Source Projects like <strong>coding, writing docs, managing team, advocacy, documentation, translation, bug triaging, reviews, organization skills, soft skills</strong> &amp; tons of other things that come as a by-product.</p>

<p>You can find the slides here: <a class="reference external" href="http://sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/why-foss">Why you should contribute to Open Source?</a>.</p>

<p>We had a break for sometime and then started with the much awaited <strong>Add-ons session</strong>. Everyone was very excited to start learning to develop add-ons. I began with explaining the initial setup details &amp; discussed JSON briefly to bring everyone on the same page. To make most out of the event, We also organized a few events previously to teach basics of JavaScript &amp; JSON so that students so that they do not feel overwhelmed with the add-ons development.</p>

<p>Then Shashank (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/realslimshanky">@realslimshanky</a>) took over and discussed <tt class="docutils literal">manifest.json</tt> and it's importance. Later we developed a simple addon -- borderify, which displays a border on every site the user visits. Some students also modified their scripts to make their add-ons do different things and posted them on twitter. Shashank, me and Shivam Singhal (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/championshuttler">@championshuttler</a>) helped everyone with their problems during the development phase.</p>

<p>Since all of us are devs, we were able to quickly resolve queries of students. One of the most important things I noticed is that often people misspell either the name of their manifest file or some key in their manifest people resulting their add-on to not load during the debugging phase.</p>
<p>A lot of them then created addons on their own and modified their previously created borderify addon to do more stuff. I've tried to <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/CuriousLearner/1a4b08dbf642be8e4dfeb9544c9ab4c9">collect some of them here</a>. For a more verbose list you can visit Twitter and search tweets tagging me (<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana">@ErSanyamKhurana</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozAMU">#MozAMU</a>.</p>
<p>Imaginations ran wild and one of the attendee created an addon that replaces the word <tt class="docutils literal">Google</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">Mozilla</tt> on every web page. You can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/husainhz7/GoogleMozilla/">his hack here</a></p>
<p>To make the session more interesting we gave add-ons stickers to anyone who answers the question about what we were just telling them. A lot of folks praised and tweeted about the addons they were generating. We were able to generate <strong>10,000+ impressions with more than 4,000+ accounts reached on Twitter for #MozAMU</strong>.</p>


<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="https://tweetreach.com/reports/20714737">read the full report here</a>.</p>
<p>Till this time, I never introduced to anyone about who am I and most importantly not listed any of my contributions in any of the projects. I don't want them to feel overwhelmed and assume that we people have some sort of superpowers that we're able to patch bugs in any FOSS project. I always make it a point to encourage them and help them land their first patch.</p>
<p>And my introduction summed that up in just one line <tt class="docutils literal">I'm one of you <span class="pre">--</span> a part of the community</tt>.</p>

<p>We then hopped on to discuss <strong>How do I start contributing to Open Source?</strong> where we specifically discussed <strong>How to find bugs on different projects through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy</strong>.</p>

<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/#/">slides here</a>. Then I discussed other Open Source projects I've contributed to like <em>CPython, Django, Oppia, Mozilla's Devtools, Gecko-Engine &amp; tried to find out similarities in various bug trackers.</em> We then had a group photo with some of the attendees.</p>

<p>It was already 5 PM and we didn't go for Lunch since students kept us busy with their questions during the lunch break too :P</p>

<p>So, we decided to hop-on to a restaurant nearby with the core-team of students that helped in organizing the event with so much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Then we clicked one last photo before leaving Aligarh at around 7:00 PM with the core-volunteers of the event who helped in all the preparations for the event.</p>

<p>In the end, I would like to congratulate the students for making so wonderful arrangements and pushing up the FOSS community in their college. I hope they will now start landing patches in different FOSS projects &amp; we'll all meet again soon.</p>

<p>In my every event I am always seeking for feedback’s from participants/attendees/visitors, doesn’t matter its positive or negative because if you know the feedback you can definitely work on it to improve for next time to make it better.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Feedback important?</strong> so I believe Feedback <span class="_Tgc _s8w">allows us to build and maintain communication with others and t</span>he most important information collected from post-event surveys is whether attendees found value in the event, whether it was worth their investment of time and resources, and whether they would participate in the event again.</p>

<p>The Squad for <strong>#MakerFest2018</strong> made sure people knew about the Web they are in, and how fast and far they can go if they go together. Often questioned, why are we doing this? We let them know that we are mere volunteers who are working to make the huge Web we are a part of, a healthier and a better place to be in! </p>

<p><span class="author-a-n8m2z75zz85z1z88zz69zi0fz76zz87z1c">Started my talk by introducing them to Rust and why I’m using Rust? I believe, Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages. It also gives a relatively familiar tool to the modern C++ developers, but in the much more consistent and reliable ways.</span></p>
<p>I believe, new system programming language solves a lot of common system programming bugs. Moreover here we have Cargo: Rust Package manager which helps to Improve your toolkit. And, Its best for Self-learning &amp; always have fun to do.</p>
<p>Please read the full story <a href="http://www.rowdymehul.com/why-should-i-use-rust/" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may explain you, <em><strong>why you should use </strong></em>Rust?</p>
<p>Then, we move ahead did some practicals where I have shown them small demos from our <a href="https://github.com/rusthacks/RustHack/tree/master/short_demo" rel="noopener">Rust Kits.</a></p>

                  <h5>GNUnify 2018</h5>
                    <h6>Vitchu on February 19, 2018 07:39 AM</h6>
                    <p>GNUnify is one of the amazing event where each and every year Mozilla India community make sure to participate. GNUnify is an annual gathering consisting of Free and Open Source software workshops, talks, seminars and BOFs (Birds of a feather), hosted by the Pune Linux User Group(PLUG) and the Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research(SICSR) in Pune, India. It is an amazing opportunity for people from FOSS communities all over India to meet each other and a good chance for newbies to find out how to get involved in FOSS projects and learn more about the free and open source culture. Mozilla has been actively participating at GNUnify since 2008!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year along with the Mozilla contributors around pune I got opportunity to organise a workshop on WebExtension at GNUnify 2018. One of the main reason for my visit is to bring some more contributors to WebExtension community and bring more webdevelopers into WebExtension development.</p>
<p>Our Mozilla track was very strong we had some many topics to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>VR session by Prathamesh</li>
<li>Marathi localization session by Narendra</li>
<li>Cook up Firefox- Privacy Settings by Ankit</li>
<li>Rust session by Mehul</li>
<li>Hardware track by Tripad</li>
<li>WebExtensions Workshop by Viswaprasath</li>
</ul>
<p>In one room we had talks and in another room I was organising workshop. It was jam packed and very tight schedule, we Mozillians were not able to talk till 3 PM.</p>
<p>I was very excitied to talk on GNUnify, from 2015 (I wanted to talk about FirefoxOS previously) I wanted to give talk there as it was one of the big event we have related to open source technologies in India. As I got opportunity this year I was very happy to delivery it there.</p>
<p>I reached the venue sharply at 9:50 and was having some discussion with volunteers about the event in past and how it grew, the story they had about this event was amazing and it gave some more energy to me. And we started my session at 10:15, I started why we need WebExtension and backgrounds of it. But 10:35 the whole lab was filled with Students and Professors (I remember talking to 3 professor at middle of session and around 50 were there).</p>
<p>After some thoughts on WebExtension I showed them the demo of my favorite extension (Youtube controller), shared the story behind it. People got excited to know why I developed it, and the next one was to search a particular word in different search engine sites.</p>
<p>Around 11:15 we started to have hands-on session. First I started explaning them explaning about manifest.json and what are all the mandatory keys and values that has to be present, once they get familiar with it I started explaning the background.js file which we coded for our “search add-on”, using contextmenu. I showed the code sample with duckduckgo, but some of them understood the logic and tried to bring their favorite search engines (like Google, youtube, bing, wikipedia). Then we had a small break.  After this we developed another add-on where we will be having our own custom shortcut keys for close the tab.</p>
<p>The attendees were interested to learn more on hacking WebExtension API. One of the amazing unique thing they felt is they are able to build similar to browser internal features. They wanted to dig more and bring some amazing Extensions in future. The response from faculty and students is amazing. I had personal talk with students for more than a hour  and got chance to talk with Faculty who is handling Web Programming session. She shared it is interesting session and told she will ping back to discuss how WebExtensions can be made into their college syllabus.</p>

<p>In future I am sure, lot of amazing contributors will be coming as a effect of this event. One note which I came to know at the end of event is most of Reps from India who are present today came from this event.</p>
<p>I personally would like to thank all the Mozillians around Pune who made my day great and memorable one. Special thanks for the care shown by Prathamesh parenets, I didnt felt I am going for the first time to his home. The garden at their home is really good and well glued with nature. I am inspired a little bit by his father, may be in future will start gardening in my apartment.</p>

<p>Started my talk by introducing them to Rust and why I’m using Rust? I believe, Rust is new enough that you can write useful stuff that would have already existed in other languages. It also gives a relatively familiar tool to the modern C++ developers, but in the much more consistent and reliable ways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" rel="noopener"><b>Rust</b> </a>is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. But, in my opinion, “<em>Rust is a good choice when you’d choose C++. You can also say, “Rust is a systems programming language that pursuing the trifecta: safe, concurrent, and fast.” I would say, Rust is an ownership-oriented programming language.”</em></p>

<p><em>Normally</em> people became ‘<em>lazy</em>‘ or ‘<em>sleepy</em>‘ after having lunch and moreover, if you get delicious Gujarati food then you can’t resist yourself to have. Upon that my talk was the first in line after lunch break so to having that in mind I have changed my talk style and from the start only I have tried to make the session interactive so the audience can also be part and their mind can be diverted. Guess what, It worked and people loved the interaction period. All an all we have a very healthy conversation during the session.</p>

                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on January 23, 2018 02:45 PM</h6>
                    <p>A Saturday well spent teaching students about Open Source, Add-ons and Privacy.</p>
<p>We had an activity at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)
for Addons, WoMoz and Privacy.</p>
<p>The session started with Trishul giving a talk on getting started with Add-ons.
He explained about Web Extensions and how they are useful. He also depicted some
of the extensions built by the community. He explained the use of <tt class="docutils literal">manifest</tt>
file and then students started making simple add-ons on their own. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension">borderify</a>
Web Extension was chosen to teach students. Me, Trishul and Shivam helped them
whenever they were stuck.</p>

<p>The next session was took by Faye on Women in Mozilla and how we can improve the
no of women contributors in the community.</p>

<p>The third session was took by me where I discussed about <cite>What is FOSS</cite> and why
people should contribute to FOSS. We then discussed on various pathways one can
start contributing. We also discussed on finding bugs through BugZilla and Bugsahoy
for Mozilla.</p>
<p>Then Shashikanth discussed about importance of Privacy issues.</p>
<p>We ended the event with a capture of all enthusiastic faces in the meetup:</p>

                  <h5>Moz-Fedora Day</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on January 14, 2018 02:45 PM</h6>
                    <p>We recently organized Moz-Fedora Day, a one day event on promoting FOSS through
Mozilla &amp; Fedora at Investopad, Hauz Khas, Delhi on Jan 13, 2018. The aim was
to depict the usage of packaging &amp; building one of the Mozilla's project using Fedora.</p>

<p>The core event focused on making the participants automate the build of any of
the Mozilla's open source project of their choice. The aim is to influence
people to switch to Linux as a build environment (We used Fedora for this)
and introduce the basics of the version control system (Mercurial in case of Mozilla).
The event will also introduce to Vagrant for running standardized virtual
machines for build environments.</p>

<p>The session began with Saurabh representing a bit about Fedora and other Linux
Distributions. I discussed about Mozilla, it's mission and different projects.
We then decided to package <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a> in Fedora and guided
folks through the steps to build the system. We used simple Vagrant setup to
package Servo project with Fedora.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, we had a small discussion on how one can find bugs
through Bugzilla &amp; Bugsahoy. The presentation can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/">http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/presentations/foss/</a></p>
<p>We also distributed some swags to folks who were able to make builds successfully.</p>

<p>Most of this was a hands-on session and I saw new faces who were truly excited to
learn about these things. A Saturday well spent, spreading the love of Open Source.</p>

                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on December 24, 2017 03:04 PM</h6>
                    <p>We had <tt class="docutils literal">MozCoffee Delhi</tt> on last Saturday, Dec 23, 2017. We had a lot of Rep
Attendees this time with other Mozillians. What would have been a better way to
end an year than the MozCoffee. From past various months, the activities in
Mozilla Delhi came to a stand still. But then we had MozCoffee planned in less
than a week. Thanks to my new mentor Trishul for arranging MozCoffee at Chaayos,
Connaught Place, New Delhi on 23rd December, 2017.</p>
<p>We gathered up at the venue in the evening and met a lot of new and old people.
We had Trishul, Faye, Sanyam, Tanzeel, Dvyik, Rajiv, Saurabh, Pushpita, Shivam, Tushar at the meetup.</p>
<p>The discussion started with Trishul explaining about his experience in All Hands Austin.
He told about various projects that have been identified by Mozilla as the major
areas of contributions. We discussed about both tech &amp; non-tech contributions
in various areas.</p>
<p>Near the end of the event, Trishul also helped me in explaining about addons.
Since I've previous experience with JS, it was pretty easy to pick that stuff up.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some amazing photographs which would now become a memory for all of us.</p>

                  <h5>Year in review 2017</h5>
                    <h6>Vitchu on December 10, 2017 01:34 AM</h6>
                    <p>2017 is one of the amazing year I had. I have dedicated it fully to  learn and share my knowledge about WebExtension and develop some WebExtension during my free time.</p>
January
<p>This is one of the best month and very good start of the year. In Tamilnadu we had lot of problems but we succesfully organised our first ever MozillaTN meetup, yes we were having amazing two day event where I was helping attendees to know about WebExtension. Before even the meetup some of the attendees started learning webextension, thanks to MDN and some of the articles I wrote </p>
February
<p>This is one of the milestone month for me, I got an opportunity to share about WebExtension in our local ILUGC meetup.  ILUGC is one of the amazing community which is having the regular meetups for past 10+ years. Giving session there was really amazing and was an exciting one for me. Then at the last week I was able to visit SRM Univ after a long time and gave some basic introduction talk on WebExtension and Mozilla Community.</p>
March
<p>In march our MozillaTN community organised our first ever over night hackathon at KCG college of Technology chennai. We had 2 tracks WebVR and WebExtension. I was handling the WebExtension session and was mentoring the students on how to build it, and it is also my first hackathon with WebExtension development. Then  on the last week went to VIT chennai to share about WebExtension, It was one day session where introduced students with WebExtension and also had some coding session to develop a small addon to close the tab on click of browserAction button.</p>
<p>Between April and June sometime I was involved in developing some add-ons and wrote blog posts about them.</p>
July
<p>Went to KCG Community space and shared about WebExtension development. We had the half a session to understand about Tabs API.</p>
<p>And early July I started planning about WebExtension on-line series where planned to create vidoes and train attendes one API per day and discuss about them on how to use it for developing WebExtension.</p>
August
<p>Went Dhirajzilla engineering college at Salem and gave an introduction talk about WebExtension. The biggest gift and surprise I got from the students I was able to meet my under graduate professor there. That was the happiest moment and I was giving talk in front of my professor about WebExtension. She was amazing person and inspired us a lot, she played a major role in shaping me and my friends during our college days. And went to Sairam college to have a booth and tell students about Mozilla communities in booth and gave a short quick talk Why WebExtension are amazing.</p>
September
<p>This is one of the good month. We planned a good open hackaton (any students, employees can join) at out KCG community space. This is the first open hackathon in that community space and around 20+ attendees attended and demoed 6+ addons. Went to another hackathon at SNS College of Tech Coimbatore, where had amazing set of students with good knowledge of what they are going to develop.</p>
October
<p>SRM university approached us and wanted to have a good purely technical hands-on session. This time we had 2 days session again (my 3rd one in a row). I was showing different demo and people loved contextMenu and omnibar search and most of them showed demo on it. And they were interested in learning it continously and the guy who hosted us was amazing, thanks to Anirudh for this opportunity.</p>
November
<p>In November after a long time had opportunity to talk at over night hackathon along with Santhosh, Karthick, Trishul. It was amazing to see kids right from 13 years. Some of them showed amazing demo like text-to-speech using Web APIs. It was cool at the same time was so tired.</p>
December
<p>Yes its year end and everything is bit slow. I got opportunity to attend All hands at Austin. I met amazing Mozillians and had lot of learning. Went to awesome dinner and Star wars <br />
It was great to plan for 2018 related to WebExtension. I am very exciting for upcoming days.</p>

                    <h6> on November 09, 2017 09:52 AM</h6>
                    



<p>Right now, I’m
on my flight back from London where I had the pleasure to assist to the Mozilla
Festival 2017. I’ll try to use this 2 hours of my flight time to relate to you
how my experience was before and during it as well as the things that really
impressed me of it.</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to the first beginning of the
Festival, Friday 27 at 5:00 a.m. On that time, I was just waking up after
getting only a few hours of sleep because of all the excitement I was having
for the festival, so I got dressed up as a zombie and after a really fast
breakfast that consisted on the remaining cookies of the pantry and a really
hot coffee that seemed like magma, I headed towards the airport. There, some
boring and long queues where waiting for me, as well as, the not well-received
security checkpoint where I had to take from my bag all the electronic things I
had on it (More than half of a dozen, I think the security guy got crazy when
he saw it). Finally, I made it into the plane and I headed towards London.</p>

<p>Once there, I
used all the time I had until the festival to do some sightseeing in London and
visit the typical places you usually go as a Tourist like the Big Ben, the
London Eye or the Queen’s Castle (With the famous queen’s guards on it). Also,
I tried the so famous “Fish and Chips”.</p>

<p>After all of
this, it arrived the time, the time to go the Mozilla Festival in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p><b><i>A few
minutes later</i></b></p>

<p>I saw the Ravensbourne building after a few
minutes going around, so big, so squarish, full of strange circles on it… I
went inside and I proceeded with the Check-In process where I got my Lanyard
and I went inside of it.  The first day
it was a Networking event, I didn’t really get involved with it because it was
my first Networking event ever and I felt like a fish out of water. Eventually
I got the essence of it and I started meeting some great people there like
Florian, Konstantina, Ayah, as well as, my mentor Michael.  After it, we had dinner in a nearby restaurant
and I headed back towards the hostel.
First day was over…</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up, 7 a.m. After
some improvised breakfast in the hostel, I went to Ravensbourne, today it was
the day to start with the sessions. I went to sessions about confidence, others
about Privacy and also, I attended a really interesting talk about
Matrix.org.  The lunch time was also kind
of Networking so I tried to engage in different conversations with people
around me, amazing time.</p>

<p>At night, Mozilla organized a party on the
Royal Society of Arts (RSA) where there was some electronic music by a guy
dressed like Tron, with really futuristic design and music. There was also some
comedy on the Auditory, it was a great night but I headed back sooner than I
expected because I felt really tired of all day sessions.</p>

<p>Third and Last day… We started the day with
a Networking Breakfast in Ravensbourne sponsored by Flattr (You should check
them out, they have great ideas). After it, I decided to go around and try the
different stuff available on it instead of going to more sessions. There, I had
the pleasure to try a great VR game about some experiments that took place in
the military, also, I got to know about The Data Detox Bar and a bunch of other
great stuff there to.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time to go, so I had to say
bye to all the people I met during the festival day and I headed to the train
(Funny story here, due to the time change, the app became crazy and it changed
my whole schedule. I decided to trust my gut and I followed my prescheduled
journey hoping to don’t lose the flight. It worked and after some crazy runs up
and down the London Bridge station, I made it into the train and I headed
towards the Airport. It was time to go back home.</p>

                  <h5>My Story with Mozilla</h5>
                    <h6> on October 18, 2017 08:11 PM</h6>
                    <p>I was in high school,
sitting in the Computers room, taking part of a boring and monotonous class
about Office IT. Because of that, I decided to open Firefox and start surfing
the web for some entertainment to make the time passed faster. So, I clicked in
the Firefox logo, Firefox popped-up and as soon as it opened, I realized about of
a yellow square at the bottom of Firefox asking me to took part of Mozilla and
become a volunteer. </p>



<p>In that moment, I
was dubitative because I didn’t really know what to do or if it was worth it
but I recalled a conversation I had with my best friend at that time about
Mozilla and its principles and decided to give it a try… I pressed the yellow
squared button and it redirected me into a webpage that showed me all the activities
I could join  (Labs, Localization,
Coding, Marketing, QA…).   After a few minutes, I decided that I wanted
to help with QA, testing some products as Firefox Beta, Firefox Nightly or the now
ceased Firefox Aurora because I wanted to make Firefox a better browser with
less bugs and more stability. </p>



<p>Once I clicked
it, it opened my email prompting me to write an E-Mail to the responsible of QA
Area in Mozilla Hispano (who I would know later as Gabriela) stating that I
wanted to contribute in that area and the reasons for it.  I wrote the email and she quickly answered it giving
me some tasks to do in Teambox (A site we used in order to organize tasks and
activities) as well as giving me some mentorship so I could start helping as
fast as possible. </p>

<p> Time passed really
quick and I went from being a newcomer to be part as a member of Mozilla without
with no more mentorship. Anyway, I kept in touch with Gabriela because she was my
friend and still the responsible of the area. As time passed by, I saw a drop
in the participation of the QA area so I proposed Gabriela a new scheme for it.
She really liked the idea and she decided to offer me the possibility of being
co-responsible of the area so I could help her with all the task involved which
I clearly accepted.  

</p><p> A year passed
without a lot of changes, I routinely participated in the friday testdays about
Firefox Beta, we also organized an amazing Spanish testday which was
well-received and well-appreciated for the Hispanic contributors of Mozilla and
I tried to help in other areas like Marketing or Localization.

</p><p> One day, I saw a
notification about a QA/Localization hackathon that would take part in Paris somewhere
near November 2015. The idea of going to Paris to the Mozilla Office really
fascinated me and I applied as fast as I could, wishing to be selected for it
so I could have the opportunity to meet other people as passionate as I for
Mozilla. Somehow, my wishes became true and I got the chance to travel to Paris
and meet some contributors there like Facyber (My great friend Marko) or
Marcia, a nice woman from Mozilla which I only had the pleasure to talk by iRC
and the one who taught us all she could about FirefoxOS in the short time of
two days. It was a really great experience.

</p><p>Sadly, one day,
Mozilla decided to cut off Firefox OS, and that decision took with it some ups
and downs which made some contributors leave the community because they didn’t
see a clear orientation or a clear focus and all the communities of Mozilla around
the world saw a big break on its activities. In that moment, I was really busy
studying for the exams of the university and other stuff so I became really inactive
for a few months and I did not really see what was coming. </p>



<p>Once I returned,
I realized how everything was stopped and I felt really guilty for it. For that
reason, some contributors and I decided that it was time to relaunch the
community and we got down to work for it. At first, we took some surveys and we
decided some goals for the community but this approach didn’t clearly work out,
so some months later, we decided to take it back and we proposed some interesting
new projects to work on and as of today, it seems it has worked because we got
new projects and new contributors working on them. </p>



<p>To conclude, I
have to add that after relaunching the community, I got really motivated so I
decided that it was time to step up and apply to become a Mozilla Rep as other
people recommended me.</p>

                  <h5>Weeks of Contribution- WebExtension Session7</h5>
                    <h6>Vitchu on October 02, 2017 12:54 AM</h6>
                    <p><strong>Date</strong> : 29th August 2017</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 8:30 – 9:30</p>
<p><strong>IRC channel</strong>: #MozillaTN</p>
<p>This is our first series of the WebExtension webseries. The main agenda of the program is to get started with Mozilla community and discuss the syllabus we will be learning in this series.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//MozWOC-Session6">previous session</a> we get learned about executeScript API, where we built a small youtube controller.</p>
<p>In the seventh session we are going to learn about building a context menu.</p>
Agenda
<ul>
<li>Introduction about Add-ons Contest</li>
<li>Context Menu Video</li>
</ul>
Problem Statement
<p>When we select some text, we get a suggestion to search with our default search engine when we do right click.<br />
So instead of having only one search engine, our idea is to have more than one search engine listed so users can use their required search engine to searching the text.</p>
MozillaIN Contest
<p>Mozilla India community has declared a contest on developing Add-ons which should be working on Firefox 57 properly (means WebExtension). Best Extensions will be choosen and the winners will be getting the Limited edition AMO Pendrive. Last date is end of October 2017.</p>
<p>You can get started with building the context menu from the following video and this video is contributed by Trishul.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://iamvp7.github.io//MozWOC-Session5">previous session</a> we get started learning what are omni box API and have built keyboard based quick multi-search engine.</p>
<p>In the sixth session we are going to build a small youtube controller.</p>
Todays Problem statement
<p>Controlling the youtube player from any tab without visiting actual tab where youtube is running.</p>
Agenda
<p><strong>Controlling Youtube Playlist without Changing tab</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about Message sending between JS file and background JS, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/sendMessage">MDN docs</a></li>
<li>Learn about executeScript API. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/executeScript">MDN docs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get started with youtube controller code flow from the following video.</p>

Problem
<p>In the above built Add-on one of the problem is when youtube is in many tabs, it will be detected in all the tabs and code is exectued in all tabs. We had a very interesting discussion around this and we have got some suggestions to work on this.</p>
<p><strong>Can you have a way to detect which tab has the playlist open? If I have two tabs with two different playlists which one will be affected by the addon actions?</strong><br />
<em>ya you found the problem rcmainak .. it will affect all the tabs. becoze we are querying all the tabs and iterating all the tabs. it will be awesome if any one of us work on this, like showing the list of tabs (by title of song) and execute script on the required tab</em></p>

Todays Problem statement
<p>In the address of Firefox / Google Chrome what happens is when we enter some words we will be getting the results from default search engine. but we will some times require to search on different site. say you know my handle in twitter is @iamvp7 so there are two ways goto twitter.com and search my handle (or) goto search engine search my handle with twitter keyword.. so it sometime gets bored. so we will build a small add-on which will<br />

                    <h6>Ajay Kumar Jogawath on September 11, 2017 06:07 AM</h6>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It has been a long time, I have been writing here. This blog post will be about sharing my personal experience during the Mozilla Campus Club Inauguration at Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, Telangana, India.</p>
<p>I have started contributing to Mozilla way back in 2012 and I am really elated that I have come a long way. All it started when a student from BITS contacted me on Facebook asking about the activities and opportunities that a student can be benefited. I told him about the Mozilla Campus Club Program to him and he got excited about it.</p>
<p>In the next few days, I explained him about Mozilla, its mission, vision, Campus Club Program, activities and how he can be a part of a global community. And then things went fast, we decided to inaugurate a Mozilla Campus Club in their college.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that we will be inaugurating a Mozilla Club on September 1st, 2017.</p>

                    SHA, aka Still Hacking Anyways, is part of international non profit outdoor hacker camp series organized once in 4 years in The Netherlands. This year it was organized in Zeewolde on August 4th to 8th and I was honored to be one of speakers at SHA for my WebVR talk.

                  <h5>It’s raining Rust at Red Hat</h5>
                    <h6>Abhiram on August 20, 2017 02:21 PM</h6>
                    <p>I know it’s been a while since I’ve put out a post and mostly because I’m trying to learn amazing things and get my hands dirty, trying to build solutions that actually make sense.</p>
<p>One such pet-project has been Rust, probably the <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/06/08/language-rankings-6-17/">fastest</a> growing systems level programming language today. Hitherto, I’ve always looked at Rust from the outside, never got my hands dirty, mostly because I was under the assumption that it had nothing to do with web development. Turns out, I was completely wrong!</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/rainofrust-campaign-trailer/15852">Rain of Rust</a> campaign gave me an opportunity to revisit the programming language and the reason why it’s been garnering interests at astronomical pace. For a nascent programming language which is in the 1.19th version of its release, it’s challenging the big guns – C and C++. Yes, you heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why">it </a>right.</p>
On to the campaign
<p>The campaign, although initiated and led by volunteers from the Mozilla India community at first was later adopted by the larger Mozilla community with contributions from all over the world like these events in <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-activate/">Mexico </a>and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/dive-into-rust-senai-santa-cecilia/">Brazil</a>. The main goal of the event was to increase outreach about the language and train developers to contribute in the rust ecosystem.</p>
At Bangalore
<p>As one of the crucial aspects of the campaign was to organize on-the-ground events and so, with the gracious support of our host Sumantro at Red Hat, we managed to pull of a small event consisting of rust enthusiasts and Mozilla Tech Speakers.</p>
<p>We had our very own Vigneshwer leading the introduction to rust and hands-on session. This was well taken by the participants who had just installed rust and exploring what they could do with the language.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>With witty remarks, use cases and insights of the language, Vigneshwer kept the participants interested. During the hands-on he introduced the <a href="https://github.com/MozillaIndia/RustIndia/tree/master/RainOfRust#rust-kits">kits </a>built by the Rust India community and explained how participants could use them to learn the language. On the whole, it was a well-rounded session and helped the participants understand why rust is important and how they could contribute.</p>
<p>We then had a talk by Ravi from <a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/">Ather energy</a> which has used rust components to send  location data packets from its two-wheeler vehicles to the cloud in a secure and reliable fashion. His talk was inspirational as the participants were able to visualize how rust could be used in a production scenario.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For the last talk of the day, we had our own ReMo and host Sumantro show a demo on <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, a simple web framework for rust developers. This was in particular interest to me as a web developer, hitherto I was under the impression that rust could only be used for parallel computing and system level programming scenarios.  Now that I know rust has a fast and safe web framework, watch out JavaScript! Here’s Sumantro’s <a href="http://sumantrom.blogspot.in/2017/04/rocket-on-fedora.html">post </a>on how to set it up on Fedora.</p>
<div class="fb-social-plugin fb-post"></div>
<p> </p>
Last word
<p>On the whole it was personally fulfilling that we pulled off a workshop in ~1 week of planning and what was comforting was that the feedback we received through the new ReMo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/activate.mozilla.community/issues/210">feedback form</a> was a 6+ on a scale of 0-7. Yay!</p>
<p>Finishing off with a mighty group photo. A round of shout-outs to Bhumika and Ra Fey for helping us out with the posters and social media calls to action! You guys are wonderful. ^_^</p>

                    <p>I had the opportunity to represent Mozilla (and my country) in COSCUP 2017 over the weekend. COSCUP is an annual conference held by Taiwanese Open source community participants since 2006. It’s a major force of Free software movement advocacy in Taiwan.

                  <h5>Why you should contribute to Open Source</h5>
                    <h6>Sanyam Khurana on June 26, 2017 11:41 AM</h6>
                    <p>My first step with FOSS was <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/how-dgplug-training-is-proving-beneficial-to-me.html">during the summer of 2014</a>, where I got introduced to <a class="reference external" href="http://dgplug.org">DGPLUG</a> (Durgapur Linux Users Group). Every year, they conduct a training over IRC covering a wide range of topics. Since then, I've been contributing to different projects, primarily to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">Mozilla's Gecko Engine</a>. Recently I also started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr%20author%3ACuriousLearner">contributing to CPython</a>.</p>
<p>Over <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CuriousLearner/">this journey as CuriousLearner over the past few years</a>, I've been fortunate enough to collaborate with some of the best engineers, learnt a lot of skills &amp; gained some nice perspective on different technologies by just contributing to Open Source. I owe my learning to them.</p>
<p>I've been always asked this question by my friends, colleagues, and strangers whom I often run into in local meet-ups and conferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why should I contribute to Open Source</li>
<li>What's in it for me</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I thought I would cover this topic from the perspective of a student as well as the perspective of a working professional.</p>
<div class="section" id="learn-new-skills">
Learn new skills
<p>When I say skills, I'm not referring to just coding skills or learning yet another framework. There are tons of skills to be learnt. These include coding, debugging, testing, writing docs, collaboration, participating in meetings etc. In FOSS, you won't just learn technical skills, but soft skills as well. That means you'll learn how to communicate effectively over different mediums and making sense to other people who might be from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>I've seen many engineers are hesitant when it comes to communication. They can think and write really nice code, but when it comes to explaining themselves, they lack the communication skills, which is vital to be a better professional.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improve-existing-skills">
Improve existing skills
<p>It's not always about learning a new tech that you heard about. It's important to improve on things you think <em>you might already know</em>. Contributing to a FOSS project would make you learn intricate details that your mentors have gained working as a software craftsmen for several years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meet-like-minded-people">
Meet like-minded people
<p>Many organizations do stand-up / all-hands meetings where everyone comes together and explains what are they're working on, what they plan to do next and if they face any blocker. So, students, there is a high possibility that when you graduate, you'll do this in your organization :) You'll meet a lot of people having similar interests and you'll learn a lot of things just by hanging out with them (most of the time on IRC).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-people-skills">
Learn people skills
<p>Learn team management, resolving internal conflicts, brainstorming on a new feature, public-speaking, time-management, conducting meet-ups &amp; learn to prioritize your work. You will just expand your horizons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learn-to-read">
Learn to READ
<p>One of the best things I've been ever taught is to "READ". (And those who've met me personally knows how many times I've been repeating this thing :)).</p>
<p>When I say read, I mean you'll read the documentation, development guide and most importantly the source code.</p>
<p>Always remember that code is meant to be read more times than it is written. When you contribute to any FOSS project, one of the important skill you add to your skill-set is to make your brain make sense out of the code that may look gibberish to many people.</p>
<p>This is a very important skill. Once you're in a company, you'll be given the responsibility of maintaining huge code base and constantly adding features to it. There won't be someone who would spoon-feed you by explaining what every line of code means.</p>
<p>I've seen many people struggling hard in their jobs to figure out what a particular piece of code does. But if you've already worked with humongous code bases, this shall be a cake-walk for you. You would already know how to scrutinize bugs, debug errors and most importantly, would have already taught your brain to think and <cite>READ</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-mentors">
Find mentors
<p>FOSS is all about mentors &amp; mentees. There are people just like me and you who volunteer their time and skill to do good for the community. You'll find a lot of mentors who would be willing to teach you different skills. Remember, that you've got this opportunity to learn from domain experts :)</p>
<p>And no matter what, always respect everyone's time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teach-others">
Teach others
<p>While it is important to get your code reviewed, it is much more important to review other's code. This would help you in learning different coding style and also about how someone approached a particular problem. This would help in expanding your logical skills &amp; as always you'll be learning a lot yourself along the way with having healthy discussions in code reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-feels-great-to-make-small-changes">
It feels great to make (small) changes
<p>You don't necessarily need to work on big features in a project or become a life-long contributor. Contribute to a project that you use on daily basis (like <a class="reference external" href="https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">Mozilla Firefox</a>) and I promise you that it would be gratifying when you see the whole world rely on the small code changes you did.</p>
<p>A small change in the documentation means you might save someone countless hours of debugging and scratching their head on how to use a particular piece of code. Always remember, documentation bugs are not something inferior; you'll learn a lot in writing documentation, right from the tools such as Sphinx and rST to expanding your domain knowledge about the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-your-reputation-career-along-the-way">
Building your reputation (&amp; career) along the way
<p>All the code you'll write in Open Source projects would be public and can be taken as a demonstration of how you write code &amp; what you can do. It depicts how you work with others and most importantly give you an enormous amount of experience in working with people having diversified skill-set.</p>
<p>Once you get acquainted with the code base, you'll be invited to develop stand-alone features and who knows you might get that commit bit turned on when you've developed enough reputation in the community ;)</p>
<p>Apart from all the things mentioned above, I think Mozilla's mission says a lot about why I contribute to FOSS</p>
<blockquote>
Doing good is part of our code</blockquote>
<p>Alright, I didn't realize, I'll be able to write this much. Hopefully, this would help &amp; motivate people to get involved in contributing to Open Source. As always, if you have any queries, or want help in contributing to any project, feel free to mail me on <strong>Sanyam [at] SanyamKhurana [dot] com</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Cool!</h2>
    <p>
      The Mozilla Reps program is open to all Mozillians who are 18 years
      of age and above. Before you become a Mozilla Rep, you must
      complete a short but rigorous application process in order to
      demonstrate your interest in and motivation for joining the
      program. Are you ready to take on the challenges and rewards
      of advancing your leadership to the next level in Mozilla? If
      your answer is YES, apply to become a Mozilla Rep today!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not sure if you're ready for Mozilla Reps? There are many other
      ways to take the lead in the Mozilla Community. If you're a
      student, register for
      the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Student_Reps">Firefox
      Student Ambassadors
      </a> program to gain experience leading projects at your
      school. And all of our contributor opportunities are available
      to you on the <a href="https://mozilla.org/contribute">Get
      Involved homepage</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mozilla Reps application process involves three simple
      steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Fill out and submit the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.reps.mentorship">
          Mozilla Reps application form</a>.
        A Mozilla Rep mentor will be in touch within 24 hours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>If your application is approved, you'll be invited to be
        interviewed by a member of the advisory council over IRC or
        IM that same week. The interview lasts about 15 minutes and
        you will be asked some simple questions about yourself, your
        experience contributing to the Mozilla project and, of
        course, your motivation for becoming a MozRep.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          If you're accepted into the Mozilla Reps program, your
          mentor will get you started and familiar with the tools at
          your disposal to start organizing events, requesting
          budgets, swag, etc. And just like that, you could become a
          Mozilla Rep!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in making the Web better with Mozilla!</p>
